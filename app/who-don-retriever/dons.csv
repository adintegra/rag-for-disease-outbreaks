2024-10-18T09:59:40Z;As of 17 October 2024, a total of 62 Marburg virus disease cases, including 15 deaths (CFR: 24.2%), have been reported in Rwanda, with forty-three recoveries. Contact tracing is underway, with over 800 contacts under follow-up as of 14 October 2024. In October, a surge team from WHO was deployed to support the in-country response across the functions of incident management: epidemiology, health operations, case management, health logistics, vaccines research, partner coordination and infection prevention and control.;Marburg virus disease – Rwanda;MVD is a highly virulent disease that can cause haemorrhagic fever and is clinically similar to Ebola virus disease. Marburg and Ebola viruses are both members of the Filoviridae family (filovirus). People are infected with Marburg virus when they come into close contact with Rousettus bats, a type of fruit bat, that can carry the Marburg virus and are often found in mines or caves. Marburg virus then spreads between people via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. Health workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg virus.The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache and severe malaise. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea and vomiting can begin on the third day. Although not all cases present with haemorrhagic signs, severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptoms onset, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock. There is currently no approved treatment or vaccine for MVD. Some candidate vaccines and therapeutics are currently under investigation.Seventeen outbreaks of MVD have previously been reported globally. The most recent outbreaks were reported in Equatorial Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania between February and June 2023. Additional countries that previously reported outbreaks of MVD in the African Region include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda.;Marburg virus disease (MVD) is caused by the same family of viruses (Filoviridae) that causes Ebola virus disease. MVD is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high CFR (24-88%). In the early course of the disease, MVD is challenging to distinguish from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Epidemiologic features can help differentiate between viral hemorrhagic fevers (including history of exposure to bats, caves, or mining) and laboratory testing is important to confirm the diagnosis. With 62 confirmed cases reported, this is the third largest MVD outbreak reported, with the majority of confirmed cases reported among healthcare workers. Healthcare-associated infections (also known as nosocomial infections) of this disease can lead to further spread if not controlled early. The importance of screening all persons entering health facilities as well as inpatient surveillance for prompt identification, isolation, and notification cannot be overemphasized. This is in addition to the importance of contact identification and monitoring of all probable and confirmed cases. The source of the outbreak, the likely date of onset of the first case and additional epidemiological information on cases are still pending further outbreak investigation.  On 30 September WHO assessed the risk of this outbreak as very high at the national level, high at the regional level, and low at the global level. However, based on the evolution of the outbreak and ongoing investigations, this risk assessment may be revised. MVD is not easily transmissible (i.e. in most instances it requires contact with the body fluids of a sick patient presenting with symptoms or with surfaces contaminated with these fluids). In addition, there are ongoing public health measures in place, including active surveillance in facilities and communities, testing suspected cases, isolation and treatment of cases and contact tracing.;Since the last Disease Outbreak News on this event was published on 11 October 2024, four additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD) have been reported in Rwanda. As of 17 October 2024, a total of 62 cases, including 15 deaths (CFR: 24.2%), have been reported. Most of the cases have been reported from the three districts in Kigali city. Since the declaration of the outbreak on 27 September and as of 17 October, 43 confirmed cases have recovered, the remaining four cases are under care at the designated Marburg treatment center. Health workers from two health facilities in Kigali account for over 80% of confirmed cases. All new confirmed cases reported within the past week, have been associated with the two hospital clusters in Kigali. As of 17 October 2024, a total of 4486 tests for Marburg virus have been conducted, with approximately 200-300 samples being tested daily at the Rwanda Biomedical Center. Contact tracing is underway, with over 800 contacts under follow-up as of 14 October 2024. Both contacts who travelled internationally, to Belgium and Germany, have completed the 21 days follow-up period and no longer pose a public health risk. The source of the outbreak is still under investigation and additional information will be provided when available.;2024-DON540
2024-10-11T10:42:52Z;As of 10 October 2024, a total of 58 cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD), including 13 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR): 22%), have been reported in Rwanda. Fifteen recoveries have been reported among the confirmed cases as of 10 October 2024. Contact tracing is underway, with over 700 contacts under follow-up as of 9 October 2024. WHO classified the outbreak as a grade 3 emergency, the highest internal level for emergencies based on the WHO Emergency Response Framework and a surge team from WHO has travelled to support the in-country response across the functions of incident management: epidemiology, health operations, case management, health logistics, vaccines research, partner coordination and infection prevention and control.;Marburg virus disease – Rwanda;MVD is a highly virulent disease that can cause haemorrhagic fever and is clinically similar to Ebola virus disease.

2024-10-03T15:54:58Z;On 13 September 2024, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) for Barbados notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a confirmed human infection with West Nile Virus (WNV) in a child.WNV is generally carried by migratory birds and transmitted locally by mosquitoes to humans, horses and other mammals. WNV infection in humans generally causes mild disease, but there can be neurological symptoms and, in some cases, it can be fatal.This is the first human case of WNV infection detected in Barbados. Additionally, no infections have been previously documented in birds or horses in this country, making this case both unusual and unexpected. However, the WNV has spread throughout the Caribbean, likely via infected migratory birds. It is possible that the virus is circulating in birds and horses undetected. Despite this, the overall impact on public health remains limited at this stage, as there is currently only one recorded human case and appropriate public health response measures have been implemented. WHO considers the current risk from WNV as low but will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation in Barbados.;West Nile virus- Barbados;The WNV primarily infects humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes but can also be transmitted through human-origin health products (blood transfusion, organ transplant, etc.). The virus is generally carried by migratory birds and transmitted locally by mosquitoes to humans, horses and other mammals. It is important to note that horses and humans cannot transmit the virus to new mosquitoes. WNV infection in humans usually causes mild disease, with approximately 80% of those infected being asymptomatic. The incubation period is usually 3 to 14 days. About 20% of people who become infected with WNV will develop West Nile fever. Symptoms include fever, headache, tiredness, and body aches, nausea, vomiting, occasionally with a skin rash (on the trunk of the body) and swollen lymph glands. It is estimated that approximately 1 in 150 persons infected with the WNV will develop a more severe form of disease. The symptoms of severe disease (also called neuroinvasive disease, such as West Nile encephalitis or meningitis or West Nile poliomyelitis) include headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, and paralysis. Serious illness can occur in people of any age, however, people over the age of 50 and some immunocompromised persons (for example, transplant patients) are at the highest risk of getting severely ill when infected with WNV. No vaccine currently exists for humans. This is the first human case of WNV infection detected in Barbados. Additionally, no infections have been previously documented in birds or horses in this country, making this case both unusual and unexpected. However, the WNV has spread throughout the Caribbean, likely via infected migratory birds. A quantitative risk assessment of the introduction of WNV into Barbados, conducted in 2007, highlighted that the presence of migratory birds and mosquitoes posed an imminent threat to the virus's introduction.;Althoughno cases of WNV have been documented in birds or horses in the country, it ispossible that the virus is circulating in these populations undetected. Despitethis, the overall impact on public health remains limited at this stage, asthere is currently only one recorded human case and appropriate public healthresponse measures have been implemented, as described above. Therisk of international dissemination of WNV from Barbados is low. The virus isprimarily transmitted through mosquito bites, with birds as the natural hosts.There is no evidence to suggest that WNV spreads easily between humans or fromhorses to mosquitoes. Therefore, the potential for widespread internationaltransmission remains low. Basedon these criteria, the overall risk related to the public health remains low.WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation in Barbados.;On 13 September 2024, the IHR NFP for Barbados notified WHO of one confirmed human infection with WNV, in a child. This marks the first detected human case of WNV reported from Barbados.On 10 June, the patient reported the onset of symptoms including headache, fever, vomiting, neck pain and painful knees, and visited a private clinic on 14 June. A test for dengue conducted on the same day was negative.The patient was hospitalized at the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of a hospital on 16 June due to worsening of signs and symptoms, including joint pain, abdominal pain, altered mental status, and slurred speech. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis returned negative results for some bacterial and viral pathogens. Despite treatment, the patients condition worsened.On 3 September 2024, blood samples were collected and sent to the Mayo Clinic in the United States of America for WNV testing. The presence of West Nile virus antibodies (IgG) was confirmed on 4 September 2024. The patient is still under care and recovering.The patient reported visiting a horse stable in February 2024 and a beach frequented by horses on 8 June 2024, two days before symptom onset. Although these exposures to horses were considered risk factors for WNV infection, the precise source of infection remains unspecified. No other suspected cases of WNV were identified, but public health authorities continue to monitor the situation closely.;2024-DON538
2024-10-02T14:53:42Z;The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of one human case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) on 5 September 2024, by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The case is a male from the Eastern Region of KSA aged between 50-55 years, with underlying health conditions. He had no history of contact with camels and was not a health worker. The follow-up of close contacts has been completed, and no secondary cases have been detected.Since the beginning of the year, five cases including four deaths have been reported from KSA. The notification of this case does not change WHO’s overall risk assessment, which remains moderate at both the global and regional levels.;Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus - Kingdom of Saudi Arabia;Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection caused by MERS-CoV. The mortality rate among MERS patients is approximately 36%. However, this figure may be inflated due to the potential underreporting of mild cases that are not detected by current surveillance systems, and the case fatality ratio (CFR) is calculated based only on laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans acquire MERS-CoV through either direct or indirect interaction with dromedary camels, which serve as the virus's natural host and zoonotic reservoir. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. To date, instances of non-sustained human-to-human transmission have been observed primarily among close contacts and within healthcare environments. Outside of health care settings there has been limited human-to-human transmission to date.MERS disease can manifest in a spectrum ranging from asymptomatic cases to mild respiratory symptoms, and in more severe instances, it can lead to acute respiratory distress and mortality.Common symptoms associated with MERS include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Additionally, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have been documented. In severe cases, the illness may result in respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. The virus tends to induce more severe outcomes in older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and those with underlying health conditions such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes.The number of MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO substantially declined during the COVID-19 emergency. Initially, this decline was likely attributable to the prioritization of epidemiological surveillance efforts for COVID-19. The overlapping clinical presentations of both diseases may have led to a decrease in the testing and detection of MERS-CoV cases. Since 2022, the Ministry of Health of KSA has been working to improve testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV by including MERS-CoV into sentinel surveillance testing algorithms, following negative test results for influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2 (responsible for COVID-19). Furthermore, the public health measures implemented to curb the transmission of SARS-CoV-2–such as mask-wearing, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improved indoor ventilation, respiratory etiquette, stay-at-home orders, and reduced mobility–are also likely to have diminished the chances of human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. Potential cross-protection conferred from infection with or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and any reduction in MERS-CoV infection or disease severity and vice versa has been hypothesized but requires further investigation.At present, there is no vaccine or targeted treatment available although several MERS-CoV-specific vaccines and therapeutics are in development. Treatment is supportive and tailored to the clinical status and symptoms of the patient.;Since the first report of MERS-CoV in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 until now, human infections have been reported in 27 countries, spanning all six WHO regions. The majority of MERS-CoV cases (2205 84%), have been reported in KSA, including this newly reported case.The notification of this case does not change the overall risk assessment. The new case reported is believed to have acquired MERS-CoV infection locally within KSA. However, the potential for international transmission is increased due to the fact that the individual visited Pakistan, while a high-risk contact traveled to South Asia within the 14-day follow-up period. Both individuals had arranged their travels prior to the occurrence of the event and before the test results of the case were obtained and disseminated.WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries. In addition, cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk), or in a health-care setting. Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV may occur if there are delays in identifying the infection, particularly in countries that are not well-acquainted with the disease, as well as slow triage of suspected cases and delays in the implementation of standard infection prevention and control measures. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.;On 5 September 2024, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of one case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).The case, a man aged between 50-55 years residing in the Eastern Region of KSA, developed a fever, cough, shortness of breath, and palpitations on 28 August 2024. He was admitted as a cardiac case to a local hospital on 31 August and transferred to a medical complex on 1 September. From there he was discharged at his request the same day, against medical advice.  A nasopharyngeal swab taken on 1 September and tested at the National Public Health Laboratory as part of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) sentinel surveillance, returned a positive result for MERS-CoV on 4 September through Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).After the patient was discharged from the hospital and prior to receiving the laboratory results confirming MERS-CoV, he traveled to Pakistan on 2 September.The patient is a non-health worker with several co-morbidities. Following field investigation, there was no evidence of interaction with camels. In KSA, follow-up has been completed for one household member, 23 health workers, and two patients who had contact with the case, with no secondary cases reported. Among close contacts listed in KSA, one travelled from Saudi Arabia to South Asia on 4 September. Flight details and personal information were retrieved to initiate contact tracing and follow-up, and no secondary cases have been identified in connection with this high-risk contact.Following the notification on 5 September 2024 from the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) of KSA to the Pakistan IHR NFP regarding the patients travel and positive MERS-CoV results, the patient was located in Pakistan, and the health authorities proceeded to transfer the patient to a public hospital for strict isolation and management of existing comorbidities.A total of 41 nasopharyngeal samples, including repeat samples of the case and close contacts were collected and tested at the Pakistan National Institute for Health/National Reference Laboratory. The patient tested positive, albeit with a low viral load, while all contacts tested negative. Close contacts, including family members and health workers, were closely monitored for 14 days, and no secondary cases have been identified.The patient was discharged on 13 September after receiving a negative test result for MERS-CoV, along with instructions to continue oral medication and to return for a follow-up appointment in five days. This follow-up was successfully completed on 19 September, confirming the patient's full recovery.Since the beginning of the year, a total of five cases including four deaths have been reported from KSA, and this is the first case reported since the last Disease Outbreak News was published on 8 May 2024.;2024-DON536
2024-09-30T19:16:21Z;On 27 September 2024, the Rwanda Ministry of Health announced the confirmation of Marburg virus disease (MVD). Blood samples taken from people showing symptoms were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Reference Laboratory of the Rwanda Biomedical Center and were positive for Marburg virus.As of 29 September 2024, a total of 26 confirmed cases, including eight deaths have been reported. The cases are reported from seven of the 30 districts in the country. Among the confirmed cases, over 70% are healthcare workers from two health facilities in Kigali. The patients are being cared for in hospitals. Contact tracing is underway, with 300 contacts under follow-up. This is the first time MVD has been reported in Rwanda. The Government of Rwanda is coordinating the response with support from WHO and partners.There is currently no available treatment or vaccine for MVD. This is why it is important for people showing Marburg-like symptoms to seek care early for supportive treatment which can improve patient survival. WHO assesses the risk of this outbreak as very high at the national level, high at the regional level, and low at the global level.;Marburg virus disease– The Republic of Rwanda;MVD is a highly virulent disease that can cause haemorrhagic fever and is clinically similar to Ebola diseases. Marburg and Ebola viruses are both members of the Filoviridae family (filovirus). People are initially infected with Marburg virus when they come into close contact with Rousettus bats, a type of fruit bat, that can carry the Marburg virus and are often found in mines or caves.Marburg virus spreads between people via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. Healthcare workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg virus.The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache and severe malaise. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea and vomiting can begin on the third day. Although not all cases present with haemorrhagic signs, severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptoms onset, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock. There is currently no available treatment or vaccine for MVD. Some candidate vaccines are currently under development.Several outbreaks of MVD have previously been reported from countries neighbouring Rwanda, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. The most recent outbreaks were reported in Equatorial Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania between February and June 2023. The affected region in the United Republic of Tanzania was the Kagera region, which borders Rwanda. Additional countries that previously reported outbreaks of MVD in the African Region included Angola, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, and South Africa.;Marburg virus disease (MVD) is caused by the same family of viruses (Filoviridae) that causes Ebola disease. MVD is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high CFR (24-88%). In the early course of the disease clinical diagnosis of MVD is challenging to distinguish from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Epidemiologic features can help differentiate between viral hemorrhagic fevers (including history of exposure to bats, caves, or mining) and laboratory testing is important to confirm the diagnosis. The notification of 26 confirmed cases, of which over 70% are healthcare workers from two different health facilities in the country is of great concern. Healthcare-associated infections (also known as nosocomial infections) of this disease can lead to further spread if not controlled early. The importance of screening all persons entering health facilities as well as inpatient surveillance for prompt identification, isolation, and notification cannot be overemphasized. This is in addition to the importance of contact identification and monitoring of all probable and confirmed cases. The source of the outbreak, geographical extent, the likely date of onset, and additional epidemiological information on cases are still pending further outbreak investigation. There is a risk of this outbreak spreading to neighbouring countries since cases have been reported in districts located at the borders with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Uganda. Further risk of international spread is also high as confirmed cases have been reported in the capital city with an international airport and road networks to several cities in East Africa. A contact is known to have travelled internationally, to Belgium, and appropriate response measures have been implemented.  Optimized supportive care for patients, which includes careful monitoring, intravenous fluid, and early treatment of complications, can improve patient survival. There are promising vaccines and therapeutic candidates for MVD, but these must be proven in clinical trials.  WHO has provided guidance to the Ministry of Health on how to manage cases. WHO assesses the risk of this outbreak as very high at the national level, high at the regional level, and low at the global level.  Investigations are ongoing to determine the full extent of the outbreak and this risk assessment will be updated as more information is received.;On 27 September 2024, the Rwanda Ministry of Health announced the confirmation of MVD in patients in health facilities in the country. Blood samples collected from suspected cases were sent to the National Reference Laboratory of the Rwanda Biomedical Center for testing and were positive for Marburg virus by RT-PCR on 26 September 2024. Samples are being sent to a regional reference laboratory for further confirmation. Samples are being sent to a regional reference laboratory for further confirmation. As of 29 September 2024, a total of 26 confirmed cases, including eight deaths (CFR: 31%), have been reported. The cases are reported from seven of the 30 districts in the county namely: Gasabo, Gatsibo, Kamonyi, Kicukiro, Nyagatare, Nyarugenge and Rubavu districts. Healthcare workers from two health facilities in Kigali account for over 70% of confirmed cases. The patients are being cared for in hospitals. Contact tracing is underway, with about 300 contacts under follow-up as of 29 September 2024. One contact travelled to Belgium from Rwanda. WHO was made aware of this by the public health authorities in Belgium. They shared detailed information on the contact's situation, that they remained healthy, completed the 21-day monitoring period, did not present with any symptoms, and are not a risk to public health.The source of the infection is still under investigation and additional information will be provided when available.  This is the first report of MVD in Rwanda.;2024-DON537
2024-09-20T08:45:13Z;On 26 August 2024, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) for Ghana notified the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the country's first reported human case of infection with a zoonotic (animal) influenza virus. Subsequent laboratory tests confirmed the presence of the avian influenza A(H9N2) virus. According to epidemiological investigations, the patient, under five years old, had no known history of exposure to poultry or any sick person with similar symptoms prior to the onset of symptoms.The Ghanaian government has implemented a series of measures aimed at monitoring, preventing, and controlling the situation.According to the IHR (2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Based on currently available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by A(H9N2) viruses as low, but is continuing to monitor these viruses and the situation globally.;Avian Influenza A(H9N2);Animal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.Avian influenza virus infections in humans may cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and influenza-associated deaths have been reported in persons with or without comorbidities.  Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, for example PCR.;This is the first human case of infection with a zoonotic influenza virus notified by Ghana. Laboratory testing confirmed the virus as an influenza A(H9N2) virus.The majority of human infections with A(H9N2) viruses occur due to contact with infected poultry or environments that have been contaminated and typically result in mild clinical symptoms. Further human cases in persons with exposure to the virus in infected animals or through contaminated environments can be expected since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations. To date, there has been no reported sustained human-to-human transmission humans of A(H9N2) viruses.The existing epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. Thus, the likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. However, if this occurs, further community-level spread is considered unlikely.;On 26 August 2024, the Ghana IHR NFP notified WHO of one confirmed human infection with an avian influenza A(H9N2) virus. This marks the first human infection with a zoonotic influenza virus reported from Ghana to WHO.The patient is a child under five years old, residing in the Upper East region, which is located on the border with Burkina Faso.The onset of the illness occurred on 5 May 2024, characterized by a sore throat, fever, and cough. On 7 May, the patient was seen at a local hospital, received a diagnosis of influenza-like illness, and was treated with antipyretics, antihistamines and antibiotics.Respiratory samples collected on 7 May, tested positive for seasonal influenza A(H3N2) virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 15 May at the Ghana National Influenza Centre (NIC), Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research. On 9 July, genomic sequence analysis conducted by the Ghana NIC indicated an avian influenza A(H9) virus. Subsequently, an aliquot of the sample was dispatched to WHO Collaborating Centres (CC) located in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (The Francis Crick Institute) and the United States of America (the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US CDC), for additional testing and validation. On 6 August, the US CDC confirmed the samples as positive for influenza A(H9N2) virus.Upon confirmation of the A(H9N2) virus infection, the Upper East Regional Health Directorate visited the patient and observed that they were experiencing a new onset of respiratory symptoms. Serum and respiratory specimens were obtained on that day and sent to the NIC for further analysis. The test results were negative for influenza and the patient has since fully recovered.The patient had no known history of exposure to poultry or any sick person with similar symptoms prior to onset of symptoms. Respiratory samples from close contacts tested negative for influenza. No additional cases of human infection with influenza A(H9N2) viruses associated with this case have been identified in the community. Illness among poultry has been reported in the Upper East Region, but the cause of the poultry disease had not been confirmed at the time of reporting. However, influenza A(H9N2) low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses have been reported in Ghanaian poultry farms since November 2017.;2024-DON534
2024-09-04T13:19:04Z;On 19 August 2024, the Viet Nam National Focal Point (NFP) for International Health Regulations (IHR) notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) variant (v) virus, in the province of Son La, a northern mountainous province in Viet Nam bordering the Lao People's Democratic Republic. This is the first-ever reported human infection caused by influenza A(H1N1)v virus in Viet Nam. The source of exposure to the virus is currently unknown. According to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to WHO. Based on the currently available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low. WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health, and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.;Influenza A(H1N1) variant virus – Viet Nam;Influenza A (H1) viruses circulate and cause disease in swine populations in most regions of the world. Of the many subtypes, A(H1N1), A(H1N2), and A(H3N2) are major subtypes of swine influenza A viruses in pigs which occasionally infect humans, usually after direct exposure to pigs or indirectly through contaminated environments. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person, it is called a  variant influenza virus . Human infections with variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease and some have been fatal. Swine influenza viruses have been detected in pigs in Viet Nam since 2010, according to results of active surveillance of influenza A viruses of swine. However, this is the first human influenza A(H1N1)v infection identified in Viet Nam.;Human infections with swine-origin influenza viruses have been reported in recent years from many countries. Most human cases with influenza A(H1N1)v virus infection result from exposure to swine influenza viruses through direct contact with infected swine or indirectly through contaminated environments. However, a few cases have been reported without an apparent source of exposure to swine in the weeks prior to illness onset. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected. Limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses has been described, although ongoing community transmission has never been identified. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. According to the information available thus far, no further human cases of infection with A(H1N1)v viruses associated with this case have been detected.Based on the available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low. Further virus characterization is ongoing. The risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.;On 19 August 2024, the Viet Nam IHR NFP notified WHO of a laboratory-confirmed human infection with a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1)v virus. The patient was a 70-year-old female with underlying medical conditions, from Son La province, a northern mountainous province in Viet Nam bordering the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic. The patient developed fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite one week after returning from spending a month in her home village in Hung Yen province. On 1 June 2024, she was admitted to a district hospital due to persistent symptoms and was diagnosed with pneumonia in addition to her underlying medical conditions. On 5 June, a rapid test confirmed influenza A. On the same day she was transferred to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases (NHTD) where she underwent treatment for six days but died on 11 June.  A sample collected on 5 June was tested through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) which confirmed influenza A virus on 18 June, but subtyping was not determined. On 1 August, genomic sequencing identified influenza A(H1N1)v virus, which was confirmed by the WHO Collaborating Centre (WHO CC) for influenza at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) on 5 August. Further characterization of the virus is ongoing.  Epidemiological investigations revealed that the patient lived alone and had limited contact with a few villagers and caregivers during her illness in Son La province. From June to 11 August, there have been no reports of respiratory symptoms among contacts, including healthcare workers of the case, or outbreaks in the community in Son La where the patient lived. There have been no disease outbreaks among livestock, including pigs, around the cases residence in Son La. There have been no official or unofficial reports from the cases home village in Hung Yen province. At the time of reporting, the source of exposure to the virus remains unknown.;2024-DON532
2024-09-02T12:28:00Z;On 20 August 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified by the country’s International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) of a laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus (clade 2.3.2.1c) in a 15-year-old child in the Kingdom of Cambodia. This case is one of 10 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) infection reported in Cambodia in 2024. From 2003 to the present, 72 cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1), including 43 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] of 59.7%), have been reported in the country. According to the IHR (2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Based on currently available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low.;Avian Influenza A(H5N1)- Cambodia;Animal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.Avian influenza virus infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe disease and death. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have all been reported. There have also been several detections of A(H5N1) virus in asymptomatic persons who had exposure to infected birds.Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with avian influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g., RT-PCR. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival in some cases.From 2003 to 20 August 2024, 903 cases of human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1), including 464 deaths (CFR 51.4%), have been reported to WHO from 24 countries. Almost all of these cases have been linked to close contact with infected live or dead birds, or contaminated environments.;From2003 to 20 August 2024, a total of 903 human cases of infection of influenzaA(H5N1) have been reported globally to WHO from 24 countries, including thiscase. Almost all cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) havebeen linked to close contact with A(H5N1)-infected live or dead birds ormammals, or contaminated environments. Availableepidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5N1) viruses have notacquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. Therefore, thelikelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low at present. Since thevirus continues to circulate in poultry, particularly in rural areas inCambodia, further sporadic human cases can be expected. Currently,based on available information, WHO assesses the overall public health riskposed by this virus to be low. The risk assessment will be reviewed as neededif additional information becomes available. Closeanalysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the mostrecent influenza A(H5N1) viruses in both human and poultry populations, andserological investigations are critical to assess associated risks to publichealth and promptly adjust risk management measures. Vaccinesagainst seasonal influenza viruses will not protect humans against infectionswith influenza A(H5N1) viruses. Candidate vaccines to prevent influenza A(H5)infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness in somecountries. WHO continues to update the list of zoonoticinfluenza candidate vaccine viruses (CVV), which are selected twice a year atthe WHO consultation on influenza virus vaccine composition. The list of suchCVVs is available on the WHO website, at the reference below. In addition, thegenetic and antigenic characterization of contemporary zoonotic influenzaviruses is published here.;On 20 August 2024, the IHR NFP of the Kingdom of Cambodia notified WHO of one case of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) in a 15-year-old with no underlying medical conditions, from Prey Veng Province. The child had an onset of fever on 11 August 2024. On 17 August, the patient was hospitalized in Phnom Penh at a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) sentinel site. On admission, the patient presented with a fever, cough, sore throat, and difficulty breathing, and on the same day, treatment with oseltamivir was initiated. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected on 17 August, and the patient died on 20 August.Swab specimens collected on 17 August arrived at the National Institute of Public Health of Cambodia on 19 August and tested positive for influenza A(H5N1) by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on 20 August. The results were confirmed by the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge (IPC) the same day. The sample was successfully sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene showed the virus to be H5 clade 2.3.2.1c, similar to the viruses circulating in Cambodia and Southeast Asia since 2013-2014. However, its internal genes belong to H5 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses. This novel reassortant influenza A(H5N1) virus has been detected in human cases reported in Cambodia since late 2023. According to early investigations, there were reports of dead poultry in the village about five days before the patients onset of illness. The patient's family was given some of these chickens for consumption and the girl was exposed to the chicken while preparing food.   The Cambodian Communicable Disease and Control Department (CDC), Ministry of Health, and local Rapid Response Team conducted further investigations. Six close contacts were identified, and oseltamivir was provided to them. All close contacts are being monitored and are asymptomatic. Further investigations and response measures are ongoing for public and animal health and the environment. Test results for samples collected from chickens and ducks from the village are pending.  Avian influenza A(H5N1) was detected for the first time in Cambodia in December 2003, initially affecting wild birds. From then until 2014, sporadic human cases were reported due to transmission from poultry to humans, either directly or indirectly through contaminated environments. Between 2014 and 2022, there were no reports of human infection with A(H5N1) viruses. However, the re-emergence of human infections with A(H5N1) viruses in Cambodia was reported in February 2023 six cases were reported that year. This case is one of 10 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) infection reported in Cambodia in 2024. Two of the 10 cases were fatal, and nine involved persons under 18 years of age. From 2003 to the present, 72 cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1), including 43 deaths (CFR 59.7%), have been reported in the country.;2024-DON533
2024-08-30T14:16:08Z;On 15 August 2024, the World Health Organization was notified of a laboratory-confirmed case of mpox with clade Ib monkeypox virus (MPXV) by the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) of Sweden. The patient reported travel to an outbreak-affected country in the African Region. While there has been recent international spread of clade Ib MPXV from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to its neighbouring countries, this is the first case of clade Ib reported outside of the African Region. Swedish authorities have implemented response measures. The only identified close contact is being monitored and the risk of within-country spread has been assessed by Swedish authorities as very low. On 14 August 2024, the WHO Director-General, on the advice of an IHR Emergency Committee, determined that the upsurge of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and a growing number of countries in Africa constituted a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR). WHO strongly advises that countries continue to follow the WHO Director-General's Standing Recommendations issued in August 2023, particularly concerning epidemiological surveillance of mpox and the strengthening of laboratory diagnostic capacities.;Mpox - Sweden;Mpox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). There are two known clades of MPXV: clade I, previously called the Congo Basin clade, which includes subclades Ia and the recently identified Ib and clade II, previously called the West African clade, which includes subclades IIa and IIb. Subclades Ia and Ib have been defined based on the emergence of subclade Ib in the South Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2023. Subclade Ia is currently considered to encompass all other strains of Clade I that are not Ib. MPXV transmits between humans through close contact with lesions, body fluids, infectious respiratory particles or contaminated materials, or (in endemic areas) from animals to humans through contact with live animals or consumption of contaminated bushmeat. Mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within 3-7 days of exposure and can start as soon as two or rarely up to 21 days later. Symptoms typically last for two to four weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system. Normally, fever, muscle aches and sore throat appear first, followed by skin rash and mucosal lesions. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is also a typical feature of mpox, present in most cases. Transmission through sexual contact has been observed to lead to the appearance sometimes of only genital lesions. Children, pregnant women and people with weak immune systems are at risk of developing complications and dying of mpox.It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmissible infections, and medication-associated allergies. A child or adult with suspected mpox may have chickenpox or even both infections at once. For these reasons, laboratory testing is important for confirmation of mpox, particularly for the first cases in an outbreak or new geographic area. The primary diagnostic test for MPXV infection is polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash - skin, fluid or crusts - collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done on oropharyngeal, anal or rectal swabs. However, while a positive result of oropharyngeal, anal or rectal sample confirms mpox, a negative result is not enough to rule out MPXV infection. Testing of blood is not recommended as any viremia is usually brief. Serology does not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses and is therefore restricted to reference laboratories where antibody detection methods may be applied for retrospective case classification or in special studies.   Treatment is based primarily on managing clinical symptoms, ensuring skin care, reducing pain, and preventing and managing complications. Where available through clinical studies or emergency or compassionate use programmes, specific antiviral medications such as tecovirimat can also be used in the treatment of mpox, particularly for severe cases or individuals at higher risk of complications. Vaccines are currently available for use to prevent mpox in some countries. WHO recommends use of MVA-BN or LC16 vaccines, or the ACAM2000 vaccine when the others are not available. Vaccination is recommended by WHO for individuals at high risk of exposure.;Regardless of geographic area, epidemiological context, gender identity or sexual behaviour, individual-level risk is largely dependent on individual factors such as potential exposures and immunity status.This case represents the first ever report of mpox due to clade I MPXV outside of the African region. Further sporadic cases may be expected, whether among travelers from endemic areas / countries or appearing through community transmission without any travel link. Further spread of the disease within Sweden from this first case was assessed by Swedish authorities as very low due to the appropriate public health measures that have been put in place. However, the travel history of this case is still under investigation, and the case was experiencing symptoms (and was therefore likely to be infectious) during international travel. To date, this appears to be an isolated case for which one close contact is under monitoring.;On 15 August 2024, the Swedish authorities notified WHO of a confirmed case of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV in an individual aged between 30-40 years. On 12 August, the individual travelled to Sweden from an outbreak-affected country in the African region with mild clinical symptoms of mpox. The travel itinerary included more than one transit and some longer stopovers. On 13 August, the traveller sought medical care in Sweden and samples were collected for laboratory confirmation and virus characterization. On 14 August, mpox was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). On 15 August, findings from whole genome sequencing by the Public Health Agency of Sweden revealed clade Ib MPXV infection. The patient is currently isolated and receiving care in Sweden.In Sweden, the patient reported one close contact (a travel companion) who is being monitored and is in contact with health authorities in the country. The contact had a sore throat but tested negative for mpox on 16 August 2024.;2024-DON531
2024-08-23T14:49:24Z;Oropouche virus disease is a febrile disease caused by the Oropouche virus (OROV), spread primarily through the bite of an insect known as a midge (Culicoides paraensis). In 2024, the number of reported Oropouche virus disease has increased in the WHO Region of the Americas, including in areas with no previously recognized history of Oropouche virus disease. Additionally, some countries have identified fatal infections and potential vertical transmission. As of 20 July 2024, a total of 8078 confirmed Oropouche cases, including two deaths, have been reported in the Region of the Americas, across five countries: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, and Peru. Brazil has also reported one fetal death and one miscarriage in the state of Pernambuco, as well as four cases of newborns with microcephaly possibly related to OROV infection. Since Oropouche virus disease is an emerging and poorly identified arbovirus in the Americas, the detection of a positive sample and confirmation of a case requires the use of Annex 2 of the International Health Regulations (IHR) and its consequent notification through the established channels of the IHR.OROV has been historically transmitted in the Amazon region. However, possible reasons for the spread beyond its historical range include climate change, deforestation and unplanned urbanization which have facilitated its spread to non-Amazonian states in Brazil and to countries where, until now, there have been no reported cases, including Bolivia and Cuba.     Based on available information, WHO assesses the overall public health risk posed by this virus to be high at the regional level and low at the global level.;Oropouche virus disease - Region of the Americas;Oropouche virus disease is an arboviral disease caused by the Oropouche virus (OROV), a segmented single-stranded RNA virus that is part of the genus Orthobunyavirus of the Peribunyaviridae family. The virus has been found to circulate in Central and South America and the Caribbean. OROV can be transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of the Culicoides paraensis midge, found in forested areas and around water bodies, or certain Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. It is suspected that viral circulation includes both urban epidemic and sylvatic cycles. In the sylvatic cycle, primates, sloths, and perhaps birds are vertebrate hosts, but a definitive arthropod vector has not been identified. In the urban epidemic cycle, humans are the amplifying host and OROV is transmitted primarily through the bite of the Culicoides paraensis midge. Vertical transmission has recently been documented and is being investigated further. To date, there is no evidence of other modes of human-to-human OROV transmission. The disease symptoms are similar to dengue and start four to eight days (range between three to 12 days) after the infective bite. The onset is sudden, usually with fever, intense headache, joint stiffness, pain, chills, and sometimes persistent nausea and vomiting, for up to seven days. Up to 60% of cases have a relapse of symptoms after the fever stops. Most cases recover within seven days, however, in some patients, convalescence can take weeks. Severe clinical presentation is rare, but it may result in aseptic meningitis during the second week of the disease.  There is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for Oropouche virus disease.;In the Region of the Americas, outbreaks of Oropouche virus disease have occurred mainly in the Amazon region during the last ten years. With geographical limitations, OROV causing persistent endemicity and periodic outbreaks are reported in in both rural and urban communities in Brazil, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Cuba, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago (7).The ongoing outbreak highlights the need to strengthen epidemiological and entomological surveillance and to reinforce preventive measures in the population. This is crucial due to the potential expansion of the virus's transmission area and the growing understanding of the disease spectrum, including possible new transmission routes, and possible new vectors that could affect both the general population and vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, their fetuses, and newborns.Based on available information, WHO assesses the overall public health risk posed by this virus to be high at the regional level and low at the global level.;Between 1 January and 20 July 2024, there were 8078 confirmed Oropouche cases reported in the Region of the Americas, including two deaths. The cases are reported among five countries in the region: the Plurinational State of Bolivia (356 cases), Brazil1 (7284 cases, including two deaths), Peru (290 cases), Colombia (74 cases), and Cuba (74 cases). Brazil has reported one fetal death and one miscarriage in the state of Pernambuco, as well as four cases of newborns with microcephaly, identified through retrospective studies in the states of Acre and Pará indicating possible cases of vertical transmission of OROV infection and their consequences.2 Three additionalpossible cases of vertical transmission are being investigated in the state ofPernambuco. Despite the evidence of vertical transmission of OROV (polymerasechain reaction [PCR] positivity on tissues from pregnancy loss reported), itcannot be concluded that OROV is the cause of the fetal deaths, andinvestigations are still ongoing.   As of 30 July 2024,five cases of possible vertical transmission have been identified in Brazil:four cases of stillbirth and one case of spontaneous abortion in the state ofPernambuco, as well as four cases of newborns with microcephaly in the statesof Acre and Pará. The investigations are ongoing(1).Figure 1. Number ofconfirmed Oropouche cases in 2024 by country and epidemiological week ofsymptom onset, Region of the Americas**Note: Data by epidemiological week of onset are not available for Cuba. Source: Adapted and reproduced by PAHO/WHO from the data reported by the respective countries.The following is a summary of the situation in the countries that have reported confirmed Oropouche cases in the Americas during 2024. The Plurinational State of Bolivia: Between 1 January and 20 July 2024, there were 356 Oropouche cases confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Transmission has been recorded in three departments: La Paz, with 75.3% of the cases (268 cases) Beni, with 21.3% of the cases (76 cases) and Pando, with 3.4% of the cases (12 cases). The cases are reported among 16 municipalities that are considered endemic for this disease, with the highest proportion of cases reported in the municipalities of Irupana, La Paz, with 33% of the cases, followed by La Asunta, La Paz, with 13% of the cases, and Chulumani, La Paz, and Guayaramerin, Beni, with 12% each.  Half of the cases are female (179 cases) and the age group with the highest number of cases in the 30-39 years age group, with 20% of cases (70 cases). No deaths have been recorded that could be associated with OROV infection. Additionally, between 16 March and 13 April 2024, five cases of Oropouche virus disease co-infection with dengue were reported in patients from three municipalities in the department of La Paz, who presented with positive RT-PCR results for DENV-1 serotype (one case) and DENV-2 (four cases) (2). Brazil: Between 1 January and 27 July 2024, 7284 Oropouche cases were confirmed by RT-PCR. The Amazon region, considered endemic for Oropouche virus disease, accounted for 75.7% of the cases recorded in the country, with six states reporting cases: Amazonas (3224 cases), Rond nia (1709 cases), Acre (265 cases), Roraima (239 cases), Pará (74 cases), and Tocantins (two cases) (3). Additionally, autochthonous transmission has been documented in ten non-Amazonian states, some of which had not previously reported cases: Bah a (831 cases), Esp rito Santo (420 cases), Santa Catarina (165 cases), Pernambuco (92 cases), Minas Gerais (83 cases), Rio de Janeiro (64 cases), Ceará (39 cases), Piau  (28 cases), Maranh o (19 cases), and Mato Grosso (17 cases). In addition, the probable place of infection is being investigated for several cases registered in the states of Amapá (seven cases), Paraná (three cases), Sergipe (two cases), and Para ba (one case).  Over half of the cases (51.9% 3779) are male and the age group with the highest number of cases is 30-39 years, with 21.2 % of cases (1541 cases) (3). On 23 July 2024, Brazil's IHR National Focal Point (NFP) reported two fatal cases of OROV infection detected retrospectively in the state of Bahia. Both cases were in females, aged 21 and 24 years old. These two deaths would be the first fatal cases due to acute OROV infection in Brazil and in the Region of the Americas, occurring amid an active outbreak on the southern coast of Bahia. Both cases, without a history of chronic diseases, tested RT-PCR positive for OROV and serology and negative for other arboviruses. The cases showed a rapid evolution from the onset of symptoms (fever, myalgia, headache, retro-orbital pain, pain in the lower extremities, asthenia, and joint pain) to death, with severe coagulopathy and liver involvement identified as probable causes of death. Additionally, the Brazilian Ministry of Health is investigating two other fatal cases associated with OROV, in Paraná and Maranh o (4).Colombia: Between 1 January and 20 July 2024, 74 confirmed Oropouche cases have been reported in three departments of the country: Amazonas (70 cases), Caquetá (one case), and Meta (one case) additionally, two cases were identified in travelers from from Tabatinga, Brazil. The cases were identified through a retrospective laboratory case-finding strategy implemented in 2024 by the National Institute of Health of Colombia based on dengue surveillance (38 cases) and through investigation of febrile syndrome cases (36 cases). Over half of the cases (51.4% 38) were female and the age group with the highest number of cases was 10-19 years, with 36.5% of the cases (27 cases). No deaths have been recorded that could be associated with OROV infection. Cuba: On 27 May 2024, the Ministry of Public Health of Cuba reported the country's first outbreak of Oropouche virus disease. A total of 74 confirmed cases were reported from the Santiago de Cuba Province (54 cases) and Cienfuegos Province (20 cases). Half of the cases (50% 38) were female and the age group with the highest number of cases was 15-19 years, with 16% of the cases (12 cases). No deaths have been recorded that could be associated with OROV infection (5).  Peru: Between 1 January and 20 July 2024, 290 confirmed Oropouche cases have been reported in five departments, the highest number of cases reported to date in this country. The departments are: Loreto (193 cases), Madre de Dios (47 cases), Ucayali (41 cases), Huánuco (eight cases), and Tumbes (one case). Over half of the cases (52% 150) were male, and the age group with the highest number of cases was 30-39 years, with 40% of the cases (115 cases) (6).;2024-DON530
2024-08-23T11:19:09Z;Between early June and 15 August 2024, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of India reported 245 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) including 82 deaths (CFR 33%). Of these, 64 are confirmed cases of Chandipura virus (CHPV) infection. CHPV is endemic in India, with previous outbreaks occurring regularly. However, the current outbreak is the largest in the past 20 years.  CHPV is a member of the Rhabdoviridae family and is known to cause sporadic cases and outbreaks of AES in western, central and southern parts of India, especially during the monsoon season. It is transmitted by vectors such as sandflies, mosquitoes and ticks. The case-fatality ratio from CHPV infection is high (56-75%), and there is no specific treatment or vaccine available. Survival can be increased with early access to care and intensive supportive care of patients.Although authorities are working to control CHPV transmission, further transmission of the virus is possible in the coming weeks, as the monsoon season is creating favorable conditions for vector populations in the affected areas.  WHO recommends vector control, and protection against bites of sandflies, mosquitos, and ticks, to prevent further spread of CHPV.;Acute encephalitis syndrome due to Chandipura virus – India;CHPV is a member of the Rhabdoviridae family and is known to cause sporadic cases and outbreaks of AES in western, central and southern parts of India, especially during the monsoon season. It is transmitted by vectors such as sandflies, mosquitoes and ticks. Phlebotomus papatasi (a sandfly) is reported to be the vector of CHPV disease in Gujarat. CHPV can cause high case fatality ratios, ranging from 56% to 75% as reported during previous outbreaks in India. The disease affects mostly children under 15 years and can present with a febrile illness that may progress to convulsions, coma, and in some cases, death. In children, it can lead to high mortality within 48 to 72 hours of symptoms onset, typically presenting with AES. CHPV has not been detected in other countries however, according to a study [3], it may be present in other countries in Asia and Africa. The sandfly vectors are abundant in the South-East Asia Region. There is no evidence that this virus has been detected among those travelling from India to other countries.;Although previous outbreaks have been reported in India, this outbreak is considered the largest in the past 20 years. While authorities are making efforts to control the transmission of CHPV, further transmission of CHPV is possible in the coming weeks, considering the favorable conditions for vector populations during the monsoon season in affected areas. CHPV infection causes a rapid symptom onset and a high case-fatality ratio (56-75%). There is no specific treatment or vaccine available, and management is symptomatic timely referral of suspected AES cases to designated facilities can improve outcomes.  CHPV infection can cause epidemics with a substantial demand on public health systems, including surveillance, case management, infection prevention and control, and laboratory capacity to diagnose CHPV infection. WHO assessed the risk as moderate at the national level based on above considerations. The risk assessment will be reviewed as the situation of the outbreak evolves.;Between early June and 15 August 2024, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of India reported 245 cases of AES including 82 deaths (CFR 33%). A total of 43 districts in India are currently reporting AES cases. Cases are sporadically present across various districts as in previous outbreaks. Notably, there is a rise in CHPV outbreaks every four to five years in Gujarat state.Of the total 245 AES cases reported, CHPV has been confirmed in 64 cases through immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IgM ELISA) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Of the 64 confirmed cases, 61 cases have been reported from Gujarat State and three from Rajasthan State. A declining trend in the number of new cases of AES has been observed daily since 19 July 2024.[1].[2] To date, no human-to-human transmission has been reported. In 2003, a large outbreak of AES was reported in Andhra Pradesh, with 329 suspected cases and 183 deaths a study suggests that this was due to CHPV.[2];2024-DON529
2024-08-22T15:53:18Z;On 14 August 2024, the WHO Director-General determined that the upsurge of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a growing number of countries in Africa constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR), the highest level of alarm under the IHR. Here we describe the latest countries in the region newly reporting cases since the start of the multi-country outbreak in 2022.  The clade Ib MPXV outbreak, which began in September 2023 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is having an increasing number of cases in the country and also expanding to neighbouring countries. Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda have each reported their first mpox cases. Several of these cases have travel links to eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and each of these countries has identified clade Ib monkeypox virus (MPXV). Based on available epidemiological data, this clade has been spreading rapidly among adults through close physical contact, including sexual contact identified within networks of sex workers and their clients. As the virus spreads further, the affected groups are changing, with the virus also taking hold within households and other settings. Additionally, Cote d’Ivoire is reporting cases of clade II mpox for the first time since the start of the multi-country outbreak in 2022.;Mpox – African Region;Mpox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). There are two known clades of MPXV: clade I, previously called the Congo Basin clade, which includes subclades Ia and the recently identified Ib and clade II, previously called the West African clade, which includes subclades IIa and IIb. Subclades Ia and Ib have been defined based on the emergence of subclade Ib in the South Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it has predominantly spread through sexual contact. Subclade Ia is currently considered to encompass all other strains of Clade I that are not Ib. MPXV transmits between humans through close contact with lesions, body fluids, infectious respiratory particles or contaminated materials, or from animals to humans through contact with live animals or consumption of contaminated bushmeat. Mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within a week of exposure but can start one to 21 days later. Symptoms typically last for two to four weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system. Normally, fever, muscle aches and sore throat appear first, followed by skin and mucosal rash. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is also a typical feature of mpox, present in most cases. Transmission through sexual contact has been observed to lead to the appearance sometimes of only genital lesions. Children, pregnant women and people with weak immune systems are at risk of developing complications and dying of mpox. It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmissible infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also concurrently have another sexually transmissible infection such as herpes. Alternatively, a child or adult with suspected mpox may have chickenpox. For these reasons, laboratory testing is important for confirmation of mpox, particularly for the first cases in an outbreak or new geographic area. The primary diagnostic test for MPXV infection is polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash - skin, fluid or crusts - collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done on oropharyngeal, anal or rectal swabs. However, while a positive result of oropharyngeal, anal or rectal sample confirms mpox, a negative result is not enough to rule out MPXV infection. Testing of blood is not recommended. Serology does not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses and is therefore restricted to reference laboratories where antibody detection methods may be applied for retrospective case classification or in special studies.   Treatment is based primarily on managing clinical symptoms, ensuring skin care, reducing pain, and preventing and managing complications. Where available through emergency or compassionate use programmes, specific antiviral medications such as tecovirimat can also be used in the treatment of mpox, particularly for severe cases or individuals at higher risk of complications. Three vaccines are currently available for use to prevent mpox in different countries (MVA-BN, LC16-KMB, and OrthopoxVac - the latter not yet commercialized). WHO recommends use of MVA-BN or LC16 vaccines when the others are not available.  Vaccination is recommended by WHO for individuals at high risk of exposure.;The current expansion of mpox in the African continent is unprecedented. At least four countries have identified cases for the first time and others, such as C te dIvoire, are reporting re-emerging outbreaks. The modes of transmission in these countries are not fully described yet and are likely to include exclusive human-to-human transmission. Clade I mpox is being identified for the first time outside of the countries that had been previously affected. Initial transmission in the newly affected countries in East Africa and beyond has been linked to travel to or from the Democratic Republic of Congo, but the expansion of the outbreak in Burundi suggests that in some settings, there may already be sustained community transmission. Epidemiological links between confirmed cases are not always known, therefore, multiple transmission chains might be ongoing in the different countries, and more undetected cases in the community are likely. Based on available epidemiological data, this clade has been spreading rapidly among adults through close physical contact, including sexual contact identified within networks of sex workers and their clients. As the virus spreads further, the affected groups are changing, with the virus also taking hold within households and other settings.  In areas or congregate settings with high population density as well in high-risk sexual networks, transmission could lead to explosive outbreaks, further compounded by population movements or insecurity. Conversely, the virus can also spread silently along commercial travel routes as in some cases symptoms may be less severe, access to health services in transit may be limited or concerns about stigma may cause persons affected to avoid seeking care.   While vaccination against smallpox was shown in the past to be cross-protective against mpox, any immunity from smallpox vaccination will only be present in persons over the age of 42 to 50 years or older, since natural exposure to smallpox and smallpox vaccination programmes ended in 1980 after smallpox eradication. None of the four newly affected countries has access to mpox vaccines or antivirals.   Based on the above, WHO has separately assessed the risk of mpox in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries as high and in Cote dIvoire, and other West African countries as moderate. This risk applies to the general population, especially those who have sexual contact with a mpox case, as well as health workers if they are not taking appropriate precautions when examining, testing and treating mpox cases.     Currently no deaths have been reported in the five above mentioned countries, however, there is the potential for increased health impact with wider spread among vulnerable groups such as children, immunocompromised individuals, including persons with uncontrolled HIV infection or advanced HIV disease, or pregnant women in whom mpox can be more severe.  There is concern that the mpox outbreak in Africa will continue to evolve given:  The evidence of possible under-detection and under-reporting of local transmission. Many reported cases have no established epidemiological link and have been identified in different countries and in different locations within each country.  While all of the governments have activated emergency responses in the countries, with support from in-country and global partners, resources to respond remain limited in some of the countries, and resource mobilization may be slow. Technical and financial support is needed to ensure a robust response at national and provincial/local levels. Although the governments and partners are all mobilized to support adequate patient care for affected patients and introduce vaccines for people at risk, these measures are currently not in place in most countries in Africa, and their acquisition and roll-out will still require some time for implementation.  Since some of the countries have not reported mpox before, public awareness of the disease, as well as knowledge about and capacity for identifying it among health and care workers in newly affected countries remains limited.  Concurrently, the global multi-country outbreak of mpox is still ongoing. Countries outside of Africa that seemed to have achieved control of human-to-human transmission continue to detect sporadic cases ` outbreaks, and an unprecedented increase of cases and reporting countries has been observed in the African Region, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, increasing the risk of further transmission in the region and the whole world.;Described below are the latest countries in the African region newly affected by mpox, either clade I or clade II, since the start of the multi-country outbreak in 2022. Additional countries in the region are continuing to report cases, please refer to the  dashboard recently published for an update on these countries including the latest epidemiological trends.  Central and East Africa  Burundi  On 25 July 2024, the Ministry of Health of Burundi declared an outbreak of mpox following the confirmation of three cases by the National Reference Laboratory of the National Institute of Public Health. These cases were identified on 22 July one case from Kamenge University Hospital, a second case from Kamenge Military Hospital, and the third case from Isare Health District. They reported symptom onset on 24 July including fever, joint pain, and a widespread rash. Samples collected during a multidisciplinary investigation tested positive for mpox on 25 July with PCR. These are the first confirmed mpox cases ever identified in Burundi.   As of 17 August 2024, there had been 545 alerts of mpox cases since the outbreak declaration, of which 474 suspected cases (86.9%) had been investigated and validated. Of 358 suspected cases tested, 142 (39.7%) tested positive for MPXV. Genomic sequencing analysis has confirmed clade Ib MPXV. No deaths were reported as of 17 August.  Confirmed cases have been reported from 26 of the 49 districts (53.1%). The most affected district is Bujumbura Nord, an urban area, with 54 of the 142 confirmed cases (38%). No deaths had been documented at the time of reporting.  Males account for 55.6% of the cases and females for 44.4%. Children under the age of five years make up 28.9% of the cases, followed by those aged from 11 to 20 years (20.4%), and those aged from 21 to 30 years (18.3%).*Kenya  On 29 July 2024, the Ministry of Health confirmed a case of mpox in Taita Taveta County bordering Tanzania. The patient is a 42-year-old Kenyan male residing in Kiambu County (neighbouring Nairobi). The case has a history of travel from Kampala, Uganda, to Mombasa, Kenya, and at the time of identification, the patient was travelling to Rwanda through Tanzania.  As of 13 August, a total of 14 suspected cases had been identified, one case had tested positive for MPXV Clade Ib,12 suspected cases had tested negative, and the test result for one case was pending. This is the first mpox case ever identified in Kenya. No deaths had been reported as of 13 August.  Rwanda  On 24 July 2024, IHR National Focal Point (NFP) for Rwanda notified WHO of two laboratory-confirmed mpox cases in Rwanda, and on 27 July, the Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of mpox in the country. The cases included a 33-year-old female (case 1) who frequently travels to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and a 34-year-old male (case 2) with a recent travel history to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Case 1 was identified at a point of entry (PoE) and isolated in Rusizi district, and case 2 was identified at Kibagabaga hospital of Gasabo district. Both cases were reported to be in stable condition and under continuous medical follow-up. These are the first confirmed mpox cases ever identified in Rwanda.  As of 7 August 2024, four confirmed mpox cases and zero deaths had cumulatively been reported by the country. Among the two new cases, one is a 34-year-old male, residing in Gasabo District in Kigali. His symptoms started on 15 July 2024 with fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, and rashes on the arms, face and genitals. He had travelled back from Burundi on 12 July 2024 and is currently in isolation. Five close contacts are under follow up. The other case is a 39-year-old Rwandan male, resident of Kicukiro District with travel history to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He had similar symptoms, along with headache, which started on 12 July 2024. Four of his close contacts have been identified and they are under follow up. Sequencing analysis has confirmed MPXV Clade Ib.   Uganda   In June and early July 2024, Kasese District enhanced surveillance for mpox disease along the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo in light of reported increasing cases in the neighbouring country. Following the orientation of screeners at the Bwera point of entry and Bwera Hospital, six suspected cases were identified on 11 July. Samples were collected for laboratory testing from the suspected cases, two of which tested positive for MPXV Clade Ib on 15 July. The first of the confirmed cases is a 37-year-old female and the second case is a 22-year-old female national of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These are the first mpox cases identified in the country. Both cases had onset of symptoms on 11 July and were confirmed by a PCR test at the Uganda Virus Research Institute on 15 July 2024. Investigations revealed that transmission occurred outside Uganda and no secondary transmission has been linked to the two cases as of 12 August 2024. By the same date, 39 suspected cases had been reported. Furthermore, 37 contacts of the confirmed cases were under follow-up. No deaths have been reported as of 20 August.  West Africa   C te dIvoire  In July 2024, C te dIvoire confirmed two non-fatal cases of mpox. The first case is a 46-year-old patient who consulted a doctor on 1 July with a fever, headache and skin rash, in Tabou district, San Pedro region, on the border with Liberia. Mpox was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur de C te d'Ivoire laboratory on 3 July and again on 14 July by the Institute Pasteur in Dakar. The second case is a 20-year-old patient, in the Koumassi health district in Abidjan, who presented with skin rash and oral mucosal lesions on 14 July. No epidemiological link between these first two cases has been identified.   As of 7 August 2024, seven mpox cases had been confirmed in three health districts: Koumassi (one case), Tabou (one case), and Yopougon-Ouest-Songon (five cases). Four of the confirmed cases (57%) are male, and all seven cases are above 15 years of age.  Forty contacts have been identified and are being followed up. The country has previously reported mpox, but no cases had been notified since the start of the multi-country outbreak in 2022. The newly detected cases in 2024 belong to clade II MPXV.;2024-DON528
2024-07-31T15:09:01Z;In early 2024, the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Surveillance System on Emerging Antimicrobial Resistance Reporting (GLASS-EAR) issued a request for information to assess the current global situation given the increased identification of isolates of hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) sequence type (ST) 23 carrying resistant genes to the carbapenem antibiotics – carbapenemase genes. K. pneumoniae strains that can cause severe infections in healthy individuals and have been identified with increasing frequency in recent years are considered hypervirulent compared to classical strains because of their ability to infect both healthy and immunocompromised individuals and because of their increased tendency to produce invasive infections.The presence of hvKp ST23 was reported in at least one country in all six WHO Regions. The emergence of these isolates with resistance to last-line antibiotics like carbapenems necessitates the administration of alternative antimicrobial treatment, which may not be available in many contexts. WHO recommends that Member States progressively increase their laboratory diagnostic capacity to allow for the early and reliable identification of hvKp, as well as reinforce laboratory capacities in molecular testing and detection and analyses of relevant virulence genes in addition to resistance genes. The assessment of risk at the global level is moderate given the challenges with surveillance, lack of information on laboratory testing rates, track and scale of community transmission, the gap in the available data on infections, hospitalization, and the overall burden of the disease.;Antimicrobial Resistance, Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae - Global situation;Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is a Gram-negative, bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is found in the environment (including soil, surface water, and medical devices), on mammalian mucous membranes and in humans, it colonizes the upper part of the throat (nasopharynx) and gastrointestinal tract. K. pneumoniae is a leading cause of infections acquired in health-care institutions globally and has been considered an opportunistic pathogen, as it typically causes infections in hospitalized or immunocompromised individuals.1 It is estimated that K. pneumoniae is the etiologic agent of 20-30% of nosocomial pneumonias in the Region of the Americas and is among the top three isolated in in-hospital Gram-negative bacteremia. K. pneumoniae has natural resistance to ampicillin, due to the presence of a gene encoding a specific enzyme ( -lactamase). Classic K. pneumoniae strains (cKp) can cause serious infections including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infection (bacteremia) or meningitis, especially when they infect immunocompromised individuals.2 In recent decades, there has been an increase in the acquisition of resistance to a wide range of antibiotics by strains derived from the classical K. pneumoniae. Two main types of antibiotic resistance have been commonly identified: one mechanism involves the expression of enzymes known as extended spectrum  -lactamases (ESBL), which render bacteria resistant to the following antibiotic groups: penicillins, cephalosporins, and monobactams. The other mechanism of resistance is the expression of another type of enzymes known as carbapenemases, which renders bacteria resistant to all available  -lactams, another classification of antibiotics which includes penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams and carbapenems.2 K. pneumoniae strains that can cause severe infections in healthy individuals and have been identified with increasing frequency in recent years are considered hypervirulent compared to classical strains because of their ability to infect both healthy and immunocompromised individuals and because of their increased tendency to produce invasive infections.;Globally, there is no systematic surveillance that allows for the routine identification and information collection of hvKp strains. Identification of hvKp is challenging given that it is determined by available laboratory capacity to perform genomic sequencing tests or analysis of specific markers that may indicate hypervirulence, so the prevalence of hvKp-associated infections may be underestimated. Assessing the current risk of hvKp at the global level aims to incorporate several risk components including 1) the emergence and sustained transmission of hvKp carrying carbapenem resistance genes, considering the public health impact of the identified resistance for the AMR related events 2) the risk of geographical spread 3) the risk of insufficient control capacities with available resources and 4) the risk of resistance spread to other bacterial species via mobile genetic elements. The risk at the global level is assessed as moderate considering that: Infections caused by hvKp traditionally have occurred within communities in certain geographical regions (Asia) and are associated with high morbidity and mortality as well as high pathogenicity and limited antibiotic choices. However, recent reports from the WHO European region and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have shown transmission in health-care settings, and several studies from China have reported clusters of health care-associated infections of hvKp hence highlighting the importance of strict infection prevention and control (IPC) measures when managing these cases in health-care settings. With the concurrence of hypervirulence and antibiotic resistance, it is expected that there will be an increased risk of spread of these strains at both the community and hospital levels. As with other resistance mechanisms, the risk of spread could increase due to high movements of people (within and between countries and regions). There are very limited antimicrobial treatment options for the carbapenem-resistant hvKp isolates and these strains have the capacity to generate outbreaks. The high conjugation capacity of the carbapenem-resistant hvKp (CR-hvKp) and the potential for further dissemination in clinical settings hvKp ST23 particularly out-competes other gut bacteria facilitating colonization and spread. Detection of the emergence of multi-resistant or extensively resistant pathogens requires established resistance laboratory surveillance systems as well as effective infection prevention and control programs in health-care facilities. Lack of laboratory capacity contributes to the restriction of laboratory diagnosis, and this affects the sensitivity of the surveillance. Most affected countries do not have the capacity for diagnosis in the clinical setting as the laboratory diagnosis of hvKp infections depends on the availability of molecular tests.  There is global heterogeneity in laboratory surveillance capacity for this pathogen because of this, there is no systematic surveillance (detection, monitoring, and reporting) of hvKp infections in most countries or regions. Outbreaks and cases are documented in a non-systematic way through laboratory surveillance for antimicrobial resistance, or retrospective epidemiological studies, making data on the prevalence of hvKp infections scarce. The prevention and control of carbapenem-resistant hvKp poses significant challenges because it has not been possible to establish the extent of its dissemination in the countries of the different regions and information on this subject is currently limited. The level of confidence in the available information and risk assessment at the global level is moderate given the challenges with surveillance, lack of information on laboratory testing rates, ability to track and determine scale of community transmission, the gap in the available data on infections, hospitalization and from the overall burden of the disease.;In early 2024, the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Surveillance System on Emerging Antimicrobial Resistance Reporting (GLASS-EAR) issued a request for information to the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Surveillance System (GLASS) Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) National Focal points enrolled in GLASS-AMR (n=124). The aim was to rapidly assess the current global situation given the increased identification of isolates of hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) sequence type (ST) 23 carrying resistant genes to the carbapenem antibiotics - carbapenemase genes - reported in several countries. The documented sustained transmission of this lineage has been observed over several years and the genes associated with the antimicrobial resistance were detected in hvKp strains in recent years in multiple countries. A total of 43 out of 124 countries, territories, and areas across the six WHO Regions provided responses: Africa (10) Europe (10) East Mediterranean (10) Western Pacific (6) America (4) South-East Asia (3).  From these, a total of 16 countries and territories (Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Cambodia, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (China), India, Iran, Japan, Oman, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the United Kingdom), and the United States of America) reported the presence of hvKp and 12 reported specifically the presence of the strain ST23-K1 (Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Canada, India, Iran, Japan, Oman, Philippines, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom).    The information and knowledge on the mechanisms that enhance the ability of the bacteria to cause the disease are still incomplete. More research is needed to develop diagnostic tools that are available in countries with limited laboratory capacity, allowing rapid identification of infections caused by hvKp strains. There is a need to discover new therapeutic alternatives aimed not only at the treatment of multi-resistant infections, but also at infections caused by hypervirulent variants. WHO African Region In the WHO African region, cases of hvKp might be present but the extent of the problem is not yet known. Detection of hvKp ST23 carrying carbapenem resistance genes or any other virulence or resistance marker requires the use of molecular methods which may not be routinely monitored in many microbiology laboratories across the region. Although data on resistance of K. pneumoniae to carbapenems cannot be applied to the entire region due to the limited number of countries that reported this resistance profile and the limited testing coverage, the resistance of K. pneumoniae to carbapenems may already be a serious problem in the WHO African region that merits further investigation and calls for strengthening diagnostic capacity, infection prevention and control interventions, and access to novel therapeutic agents. WHO Region of the Americas In the Region of the Americas, there is consolidated AMR surveillance, which has made it possible to widely document the detection of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) strains carrying carbapenem resistance genes. However, there is no systematic surveillance that allows the routine identification of hvKp strains and allows the collection of information on these strains. Health systems and health-care services in some countries in the Region may encounter challenges in implementing infection control measures, as well as in identifying and adequately responding to cases of hvKp infection carrying carbapenem resistance genes. The lack of clinical suspicion, detection, and implementation of infection control measures indicated for the cases (standard and contact precautions, including isolation), as well as the detection and management of people who are colonized by the bacteria, are some of the challenges to be considered in the face of an increased risk of spread of carbapenemase-carrying hvKp strains in hospital and community settings. WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region The available data on the prevalence of hvKp is scarce in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region and is documented only through laboratory surveillance for AMR within healthcare facilities or retrospective epidemiological studies in a few countries. Although two countries in the region (Iran and Oman) have reported the presence of hvKp since 2018, little is known about the extent of its dissemination or the situation in most of the countries in the region. With limited microbiology laboratory infrastructure and capacity to detect hvKp in most of the countries and with protracted or active conflicts or other fragile or vulnerable contexts in at least nine countries, improved surveillance requires increased investment in building laboratory networks, ensuring uninterrupted supplies, and appropriate training for laboratory personal. Increased engagement with non-state actors may be required in fragile, conflict-affected and vulnerable settings. The probability of hvKp going undetected is high in many of these settings and with substantial movements between countries in the region, the clinical and public health implications remain high. WHO European Region Resistance to the third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics in Kp has become widespread in the WHO European Region. While many European laboratories regularly perform tests to characterize the bacteria and have the capacity for molecular identification of the most frequent carbapenem resistance genes, the identification of genes that enhance the ability of the bacteria to cause a disease (virulence) is currently not part of standard diagnostics. Since the detection of hypervirulence is not part of routine diagnostic microbiology, hvKp may go unnoticed, unless suspected by clinicians with awareness of the clinical picture and requesting the isolates to be referred for further characterization or sequencing. The clinical presentation and extended disease spectrum of hvKp has not yet been encountered by many clinicians in countries of the European region. In addition, a presumptive clinical diagnosis would depend on the presentation of the typical clinical features of a community-onset infection. This clinical picture may, however, differ in vulnerable patients in health-care settings, likely making the clinical diagnosis of healthcare-associated hvKp difficult. WHO South-East Asia Region The WHO South-East Asia Region has documented the convergence of genes related to both hypervirulence and carbapenem resistance, a critical factor that exacerbates the challenge of managing infections caused by hvKp. In India, efforts have been made to characterize Kp isolates since 2015. The carbapenem-resistant hvKp was identified in India in 2016, and subsequently, its clinical profile, antibiogram, molecular epidemiology, evolutionary trajectory, and the prevalence of hvKp variants were reported. The convergence of mechanisms that enhance the ability of the bacteria to cause a disease (virulence) and antimicrobial resistance in K. pneumoniae has been detected in various occasions. The roles of resistance and this virulence genes in different types of K. pneumoniae have also been studied.   However, systematic surveillance is not yet developed in most countries in the Region, making it difficult to monitor the circulation levels of these strains effectively. Despite the establishment of national AMR surveillance systems in several countries, there are significant gaps in diagnostic and epidemiological capacities, which are still evolving. The detection and identification of hvKp strains are highly reliant on laboratory capacity, which varies widely across the region. Many laboratories lack the necessary resources to perform genomic sequencing or to analyze specific markers indicating hypervirulence. Consequently, hvKp-associated infections are likely under-detected and under-reported, obscuring the true extent of the threat they pose. The traditional clinical diagnosis delineation of hvKp from classical Kp has become more challenging in the region because of the changing epidemiology of hvKp, which is now more commonly acquired in hospitals from patients with co-morbidities than in the community. The risk of having high prevalence of the disease may also be increased by rising co-morbidities, especially diabetes, as well as contributory variables such as high-density populations and inadequate access to high-quality health care in the region. WHO Western Pacific Region In the WHO Western Pacific region, due to widespread antibiotic resistance and insufficient measures to prevent infection in various areas, it is possible that instances of hvKp have occurred but have not been fully recognized. Identifying hvKp strains such as ST23 that possess carbapenem resistant genes or other significant virulence or resistance traits necessitates enhanced diagnostic tests, which are not commonly employed in standard microbiology laboratories. Several Member States in this region have the capacity to conduct antimicrobial susceptibility testing and detect Kp strains with carbapenem resistance.;2024-DON527
2024-07-22T08:35:12Z;On 14 June 2024, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MoHME) of Iran reported the first two locally acquired cases of dengue recorded in the country. Local transmission of dengue within the community was confirmed in Bandar-Lengheh, Hormozgan Province, southern Iran. As of 17 July 2024, the total number of locally acquired (autochthonous) dengue cases in the country has risen to 12, all reported in Bandar-Lengheh.Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the dengue virus, with the potential to cause a serious public health impact. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are mosquitos of the Aedes genus, primarily Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus.Iran's MoHME has enacted measures to strengthen hospital readiness. The World Health Organization (WHO) is supporting the MoHME to enhance surveillance, distributing medical and rapid diagnostic supplies, providing training, and organizing risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) activities.On 16 May 2024, WHO reassessed the global risk of dengue as high, reiterating that dengue remains a global public health threat. The risk for Iran is also high due to the presence of the vector in the country, favourable climate conditions for the vector and the movement of people from countries with ongoing dengue outbreaks and endemic areas to Iran.;Dengue – Iran (Islamic Republic of);Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV), with the potential to cause a serious public health impact. Dengue infections are the most common vector-borne viral infections worldwide, particularly impacting tropical and subtropical countries. The virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, most commonly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The proliferation and propagation of mosquitoes depend on climatic factors such as temperature, humidity and rainfall. The virus can be carried by infected travelers (imported cases) and may establish new areas of local transmission where there is a susceptible population and the local presence of vectors.DENV has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the same serotype and short-term immunity to the other serotypes, after which secondary infections with a different serotype increase the risk for severe dengue. Dengue cases are most commonly asymptomatic or result in mild febrile illness. However, some cases will develop severe dengue, which may involve shock, severe bleeding or severe organ impairment. This stage often starts after the fever has gone away and it is preceded by warning signs such as intense abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding gums, fluid accumulation, lethargy or restlessness, and liver enlargement.There is no specific treatment for dengue, but the timely diagnosis of dengue cases, identification of warning signs for severe dengue, and appropriate clinical management are key elements of care to prevent the progression to severe dengue and deaths. WHO recommends the TAK-003 dengue licensed vaccine in children aged 6-16 years in settings with high dengue transmission intensity.;This represents the first report of autochthonous dengue cases ever documented in Iran. The confirmation of local dengue transmission in 2024 is thus an atypical yet foreseeable event due to the presence of the vector in the country and the movement of people from endemic areas to Iran.Based on entomological surveillance, to date, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are present in the provinces of Baluchistan, Bushehr, Fars, Gilan, Golestan, Hormozgan, Khuzestan, Mazandaran and Sistan.On 16 May 2024, WHO reassessed the global risk of dengue, confirming it to be high and emphasizing that dengue continues to pose a significant public health threat worldwide.The national risk for Iran is also high due to the presence of the vector in the country, favorable climate conditions for the competent vector and the movement of people from countries experiencing ongoing outbreaks and endemic areas to Iran. There is heightened awareness of the potential increase in importations and subsequent transmission of the disease during the upcoming Arbaeen pilgrimage in August, when millions of people from different countries, including countries reporting dengue cases travel to Iran.;On 14 June 2024, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MoHME) of Iran reported local transmission of dengue in Bandar-Lengheh, Hormozgan Province, within southern Iran.Two cases of dengue, without any history of travel outside Iran, were confirmed through Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing conducted by the Arbovirus laboratories of the Pasteur Institute in Bandar Abbas. By 17 July 2024, a total of 12 autochthonous cases of dengue have been documented in Iran, all of which were reported in Bandar-Lengheh, Hormozgan Province.  Iran had been reporting an average of 20 imported dengue cases annually between 2017 and 2023. However, there was a significant increase in imported dengue cases in 2024, with 137 reported between 15 May and 10 July.  This represents the first report of autochthonous dengue cases in Iran. The confirmation of local dengue virus transmission in 2024 is therefore an unusual although expected event due to the presence of the vector in the country and movement of people from endemic areas to Iran. Based on entomological surveillance, to date, Aedes aegypti and some Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are established in the provinces of Sistan and Balouchistan, Hormozgan, Bushehr, Khuzastan, and Gilan.  In the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, dengue outbreaks continue to be reported in both fragile, conflict-affected, and/or vulnerable countries in the region that have weakened healthcare systems as well as countries with stronger healthcare systems that have been affected by unusual rains due to climate change. Ae. aegypti and some Ae. albopictus mosquitoes have been identified in most of the countries in the region.;2024-DON526
2024-07-09T10:02:29Z;The International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) of the Republic of South Africa notified WHO of 20 confirmed mpox cases between 8 May and 2 July 2024, including three deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) of 15%). These cases were reported in three of nine provinces: Gauteng (10 cases 1 death), Western Cape (1 case), and KwaZulu-Natal (9 cases 2 deaths). These are the first cases of mpox reported in South Africa since 2022 when the country had reported five cases, none of which were severe, and no deaths.The persons affected are men aged between 17 and 43 years old, and of the first 16 cases, 11 self-identified as men who have sex with men (MSM). At least 15 cases are living with HIV with unmanaged or only recently diagnosed HIV infection, and have advanced HIV disease (AHD), and one case has diabetes. The type of exposure contact reported by cases is sexual contact.  Eighteen of the patients required hospitalization.Several response measures have been put in place by national health authorities with the support of WHO. The sudden appearance of these cases none of whom reported any history of international travel, the extremely high HIV prevalence among confirmed cases, and the high case-fatality ratio suggest that the confirmed cases are only a small proportion of all cases that might have occurred, and that community transmission is ongoing.The risk to human health for the general public remains low in the country. The risk for gay men, bisexual men, other men who have sex with men, trans and gender-diverse people, and sex workers is moderate. There is potential for increased health impact should wider dissemination among these and other vulnerable groups in South Africa and neighbouring countries continue.This event emphasizes that the global mpox outbreak linked to clade IIb monkeypox virus (MPXV) is still ongoing, and the risk of cross-border and international spread persists in all WHO regions.;Mpox – South Africa;Mpox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). There are two known clades of MPXV: clade I, previously called the Congo Basin clade and clade II, previously called the West African clade, which includes subclades IIa and IIb. MPXV transmits between humans through close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets or contaminated materials, or from animals to humans through contact with live animals or consumption of contaminated bushmeat. Mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within a week of exposure but can start 1-21 days later. Symptoms typically last 2-4 weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system. Fever, muscle aches and sore throat appear first, followed by skin and mucosal rash. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is also a typical feature of mpox, present in most cases. Children, pregnant women and people with weak immune systems are at risk of developing complications and death from mpox.It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmissible infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also concurrently have another sexually transmissible infection such as herpes. Alternatively, a child or adult with suspected mpox may have chickenpox. For these reasons, laboratory testing of skin specimens obtained by swabbing is important for confirmation of mpox, particularly for the first cases in an outbreak or new geographic area, and implementation of public health and social measures to curb transmission.Treatment is based primarily on managing clinical symptoms, ensuring skin care, reducing pain, and preventing and managing complications. Where available through emergency or compassionate use programmes, specific antiviral medications such as tecovirimat can also be used in the treatment of mpox, particularly for severe cases or individuals at higher risk of complications.;The sudden appearance of unlinked cases of mpox in South Africa without a history of international travel, the high HIV prevalence among confirmed cases, and the high case fatality ratio suggest that community transmission is underway, and the cases detected to date represent a small proportion of all mpox cases that might be occurring in the community it is unknown how long the virus may have been circulating. This may in part be due to the lack of early clinical recognition of an infection with which South Africa previously gained little experience during the ongoing global outbreak, potential pauci-symptomatic manifestation of the disease, or delays in care-seeking behaviour due to limited access to care or fear of stigma.  At present, most of the transmission in the initial cases is linked to recent sexual contacts among men, similar to the spread in newly affected countries during the 2022-2024 multi-country outbreak. For most confirmed cases, no epidemiological link has been established, possibly due in part to incomplete contact identification. This suggests that undetected community transmission is occurring and that further cases can be expected as surveillance is strengthened. The current risk to human health for the general public remains low in the country. The risk for gay men, bisexual men, other men who have sex with men, trans and gender diverse people, and sex workers is moderate, as currently assessed for the global outbreak. The higher risk assessment is consistent with ongoing transmission among recognized risk groups due mainly to exposure through sexual contact, and the higher prevalence of undetected or uncontrolled HIV infection in the country which also puts people at risk of severe disease. There is potential for increased health impact should wider dissemination continue in vulnerable groups in South Africa or neighbouring countries. Data from ongoing mpox outbreaks show that the risk of severe disease and death is higher among children, immunocompromised individuals including persons with poorly controlled HIV, and pregnant women.  The most recent Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) data estimate HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men in South Africa to be around 30%, only 44% of whom are on antiretroviral therapy. This makes this group extremely vulnerable to severe mpox disease and death. There is also a hazard to health workers if they are not appropriately using personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with mpox.  Prior to 2022, the CFR for clade II MPXV in West Africa was estimated to be 3.6% (95% CI: 1.7%, 6.8%). Case fatality in the ongoing multi-country outbreak (0.2%) is the lowest recorded for MPXV clade II. In contrast, the CFR among cases reported in South Africa in 2024 is extremely high (15%), as most detected cases are among persons who are immunocompromised with uncontrolled HIV and other co-morbidities. Persons with less severe mpox are less likely to recognize the condition or seek diagnosis and care therefore, such cases may remain undetected and unreported. Vaccination with mpox vaccines has been shown to be effective against mpox. The last case of smallpox in South Africa was reported in 1972, and smallpox vaccination stopped shortly after the global eradication of the disease in 1980. Thus, any immunity from prior smallpox vaccination (which is cross-protective for mpox) will at best now only be present in some persons over the age of 44 years. The median age of mpox cases in the current global outbreak is 34 years (IQR: 29 - 41) and within South Africa, reported cases are aged between 17-43 years. The limited awareness of mpox and lack of knowledge about practices for prevention among health workers and among key populations such as sex workers or men who have sex with men in the country exacerbates their risk for mpox. Anyone suffering from disfiguring skin conditions, including mpox, may experience fear and stigma, which can be further compounded for key populations. There is concern that the mpox outbreak in South Africa will continue to evolve given:  The high likelihood of under-detection and under-reporting of local transmission, given that reported cases have to date almost exclusively affected the most vulnerable.Currently, all detected cases have presented with severe disease and extensive skin lesions, which could lead to more viral transmission and risks poor outcomes for the patients. While the government and partners are mobilized to introduce treatment for affected patients and vaccines for people at risk, these countermeasures are not yet widely available in the country.  Public awareness of mpox and information about modes of transmission or possible amplifying events or risk of exposure in sex-on-premises venues remains limited in South Africa.   Concurrent outbreaks of mpox are occurring in Africa and elsewhere, increasing the risk of further transmission.;The IHR NFP of the Republic of South Africa notified WHO of 20 confirmed mpox (monkeypox) cases between 8 May and 2 July 2024, including three deaths (CFR 15%). These cases were reported in three of nine provinces: Gauteng (10 cases 1 death), Western Cape (1 case), and KwaZulu-Natal (9 cases 2 deaths). The cases are all male, aged between 17 and 43 years, and almost all self-identified as men who have sex with men (MSM). Most are persons living with HIV, with unmanaged or only recently diagnosed HIV infection and advanced HIV disease (AHD), and one has diabetes. All cases were symptomatic, with extensive skin lesions and 18 required hospitalization. None of the confirmed cases reported a history of international travel and none reported attending high-risk social gatherings. The type of exposure reported by cases is sexual contact. For the first 16 cases overall, 44 contacts were identified in KwaZulu-Natal, 39 contacts in Western Cape, and 55 in Gauteng province. While three of the four initial cases in KwaZulu-Natal were epidemiologically linked through contact tracing, at least the initial seven in Gauteng province were not found to be epidemiologically linked, suggesting community transmission is underway.  Individual contact tracing for recent cases is ongoing. In addition, limited information suggests that some affected persons have attended and been exposed to mpox at parties or clubs where sexual activity occurs.Genomic sequencing, available for five confirmed cases has identified sub-clade IIb MPXV, the clade linked to the multi-country mpox outbreak.   During the ongoing 2022-2024 multi-country outbreak, five mpox cases had previously been confirmed in South Africa, during the peak in June-August 2022, and all had reported travel abroad. None of the cases were severe. No cases were reported in 2023. Figure 1. Geographic distribution of reported mpox cases and deaths, South Africa, 8 May to 2 July 2024 (n=20);2024-DON525
2024-06-14T15:37:04Z;In December 2022, the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared a national outbreak of mpox and an incident management system has been in place since February 2023, based on the increasing number of reported cases.   Since September 2023, an outbreak of mpox in South Kivu province has continued to spread within the province and recently to neighbouring North Kivu, driven by sexual contact transmission. A new variant of clade I MPXV has been described in South Kivu. It carries predominantly APOBEC3-type mutations, indicating adaptation of the virus due to circulation among humans. It was estimated to have emerged around mid-September 2023, and its human-to-human transmission has been ongoing since then. This is the first documented sustained community transmission of the virus in the country.   It is not known if this variant is more transmissible or leads to more severe disease than other clade I MPXV strains. Additionally, it carries gene deletions that affect diagnostics in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. To date, only clade I MPXV has been detected in the country, which in the WHO African region, reports the highest number of cases. In 2024, as of 26 May, a total of 7 851 mpox cases were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including 384 deaths (Case Fatality Rate (CFR) 4.9%). These cases were reported in 177 of the 519 (34%) health zones across 22 out of the 26 provinces (85%).  The continuing development of the mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains concerning due to the continuing high incidence of mpox reported in endemic areas of the country in recent years with high case fatality, the geographic expansion to previously unaffected areas, the appearance of a novel strain of clade I MPXV, the observed sustained community transmission driven by sexual transmission and other forms of close physical contact in the eastern part of the country, resource constraints to respond over such a wide geographic area, limited public awareness of mpox, the insufficient availability of treatment kits and lack of vaccines to date, multiple competing public health priorities, and insecurity. Based on the situation, WHO assesses that the risk associated with mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains high.;Mpox - Democratic Republic of the Congo;Mpox (monkeypox) is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). There are two known clades of MPXV: clade I, previously called the Congo Basin clade and clade II, previously called the West Africa clade, which includes subclades IIa and clade IIb. MPXV transmits between humans through close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets or contaminated materials, or from animals to humans through contact with live animals or consumption of contaminated bushmeat. Mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within a week but can start 1-21 days after exposure. Symptoms typically last 2-4 weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system. Fever, muscle aches and sore throat appear first, followed by skin and mucosal rash. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is also a typical feature of mpox, present in most cases. Children, pregnant women and people with weak immune systems are at risk of developing complications and death from mpox. It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmissible infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also concurrently have another sexually transmissible infection such as herpes. Alternatively, a child or adult with suspected mpox may also have chickenpox. For these reasons, laboratory testing is important for confirmation of mpox, particularly for the first cases in an outbreak or new geographic area, and implementation of relevant public health and social measures to curb transmission. Detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred laboratory test for mpox. The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash - skin, fluid or crusts - collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done on oropharyngeal, anal or rectal swabs. However, while a positive result of oropharyngeal, anal or rectal sample confirms mpox, a negative result is not enough to rule out MPXV infection. Testing of blood is not recommended. Serology does not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses and is therefore restricted to reference laboratories where antibody detection methods may be applied for retrospective case classification or in special studies. Treatment is based on skin scare, managing pain, and preventing complications. In addition, specific antiviral medications such as tecovirimat can also be used in the treatment of mpox, particularly for severe cases or individuals at higher risk of complications.;In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, most reported cases in known endemic provinces continue to be among children under 15 years of age, especially in young children. Infants and children under five years of age are at highest risk of severe disease and death, particularly where prompt optimal case management is limited or unavailable. The number of cases reported weekly remains consistently high while the outbreak continues to expand geographically. High test positivity among tested cases in most provinces also suggests that undetected transmission is likely ongoing in the community. Transmission of mpox due to clade I MPXV via sexual contact in key populations was first identified in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2023. In South Kivu province, mpox transmission is sustained through human-to-human contact (sexual and non-sexual).   The global outbreak 2022 – 2024 has shown that sexual contact enables faster and more efficient spread of the virus from one person to another due to direct contact of mucous membranes between people, contact with multiple partners, a possibly shorter incubation period on average, and a longer infectious period for immunocompromised individuals. The newly documented occurrence of mpox in North Kivu is very concerning. The additional public health impact of sustained human-to-human sexual transmission of mpox in the country indicates that a vigorous response is required. One of the main risk factors for severe disease and death among persons with mpox is immune suppression, especially among those with advanced HIV infection. The prevalence of HIV in the general adult population in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is estimated to be approximately 1%, higher in the eastern provinces than elsewhere, and higher in key populations including estimates of a prevalence of 7.5% among sex workers and 7.1% among men who have sex with men. The higher HIV prevalence and the challenge in accessing antiretroviral treatment puts these groups at higher risk for severe mpox and death if they get infected. The occurrence of cases among a broad range of occupational groups and within households also suggests that the outbreak in South Kivu is already spreading into the wider community. Understanding of the dynamics of MPXV transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is improving with the emergency measures being put in place. Nonetheless, a lack of timely access to diagnostics in many areas, incomplete epidemiological investigations, challenges in contact tracing and extensive but inconclusive animal investigations continue to hamper rapid response. While zoonotic spill over events are considered to still represent a major source of exposure in the country, the animal reservoir remains unknown. The new features of human-to-human transmission observed in South Kivu and North Kivu raise additional concern about a further rapid expansion of the outbreak in the eastern mining provinces, as well as the rest of the country and other countries which share national borders. From 1 January to 26 May 2024, 7 851 suspected cases were reported, compared to 3 924 suspected cases reported during the same period in 2023. The geographic expansion to new areas, such as Kinshasa and North Kivu, continues in 2024. Only 3 of 26 provinces have not yet reported mpox in 2024. While some cases in the newly affected provinces are linked to travel from endemic areas, others represent secondary or sustained human-to-human transmission, and the source of infection for several of them remains unknown. The current situation remains extremely concerning as MPXV continues to move into the immunity gap left following eradication of smallpox.  Surveillance and investigating alerts are limited by logistical and resource challenges, and laboratory capacities are limited to two national laboratories, one in Kinshasa and one in Goma so only 18% of reported cases in 2024 have been tested by PCR. Testing through GeneXpert has begun in Equateur and South Kivu province, and validation of the findings is ongoing. Response capacities to mpox in the country rely to a great extent on the support of WHO and other partners. Immunogenicity and safety studies of MVA-BN vaccine have been ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 2016. The national immunization technical advisory group (GTCV) released recommendations on the use of mpox vaccines in the country for persons at risk. These included recommendations for preferred use of LC16 in children and use of MVA-BN in adults. The Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Prevention (MSPHP) has announced its intention to vaccinate persons at risk through use of LC16 and MVA-BN vaccinia-based mpox vaccines and asked the national regulatory authority (ACOREP),) to authorize temporary use of these vaccines. This regulatory review is underway. Further clinical efficacy and safety studies are being planned for LC16 in the country. The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) is developing emergency response immunization strategies for persons and areas at risk through extensive consultation internally, with WHO and with partners. The antiviral medication tecovirimat is undergoing clinical efficacy studies in two study sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Kole in Sankuru Province and Tunde in Maniema Province. This study is expected to complete recruitment in 2024. Access to tecovirimat is possible through request from WHO for compassionate use or through application for use under the WHO MEURI protocol. Risk communication and community engagement are of critical importance for modes of transmission historically reported as community outbreaks including from consumption of bushmeat, as well as for the newly described risk of sexual transmission, particularly among sex workers and other key populations. According to a study conducted by USAID and Breakthrough Action in 2022, awareness of the risks associated with mpox among the general population in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was low, despite the disease being reported in remote endemic areas since 1970. The lack of effective dissemination to date of health messages for key populations such as sex workers or men who have sex with men in the country exposes them to further risk. Anyone suffering from disfiguring skin conditions, including mpox, may suffer from fear and stigma, which can be further compounded for persons at risk of acquiring the disease through sexual contact. The continued development of the mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains concerning due to: The continuing high incidence of cases reported in 2024 compared to previous years, with two thirds of reported cases and more than four fifths of deaths occurring primarily among children in known endemic areas. Transmission through sexual contact of clade I MPXV among key populations and other groups with multiple partners and high mobility in densely populated mining areas has led to sustained community transmission in South Kivu.  The outbreak characterized by sexual contact transmission has revealed a new strain of MPXV with genetic mutations suggestive of extended human-to-human transmission and geographic expansion. This new MPXV strain is affecting newly reported areas in southern and eastern provinces. While it is not known whether this variant is inherently more transmissible or leads to more severe diseases than other virus strains circulating in the country, co-infections with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections are being documented.  In 2023 and 2024, mpox cases have occurred in ​​Kinshasa associated with river boat travel and leading to outbreaks in the city. At the time of reporting, new cases in the Nsele health zone in Kinshasa have been confirmed. There is high (around 70% overall) or very high (around 90% in South Kivu) test positivity among reported cases, despite efforts to significantly expand surveillance. This suggests significant under detection or underreporting of transmission. While the government has activated an emergency response across the country with support from in-country and global partners, resources to respond over such a wide geographic area remain insufficient, and resource mobilization is slow.  Public awareness remains limited, resources are scarce, and technical as well as financial support is needed to ensure a robust response at provincial/local, national, and international levels. A concurrent outbreak of mpox is occurring in the Republic of Congo, with cases genetically similar to the MPXV strain circulating in neighbouring endemic provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo provinces.   A new outbreak of mpox due to clade IIb MPXV linked to the ongoing global outbreak is occurring among key populations in the Republic of South Africa, with to date only cases with severe disease and advanced HIV infection being reported, suggesting extensive undetected circulation of the virus. Travel between South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo linked to commercial activity between the two countries further puts populations at risk. In epidemiological week 16 to 18, an outbreak of 45 suspected cases of mpox were reported in two prison cells in Lodja Health Zone in Sankuru Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Samples were collected and sent to the lab for confirmation and results are currently awaited.;Since 2022, an epidemic of mpox caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV) clade IIb has been ongoing globally, affecting many countries outside the African continent that had never reported mpox previously. Its spread has been mainly driven and sustained by transmission via sexual contact among men who have sex with men, who represent the most affected group.  Although, MPXV strains circulating in Democratic Republic of the Congo belong to clade I, and no cases of MPXV clade IIb have so far been detected, an increase of reported cases, as well as a geographical expansion of their distribution, has been observed in the country since 2022.  Transmission due to sexual contact of MPXV clade I was first formally documented in April 2023 in a small cluster of cases in Kwango province, as mentioned in the previous Disease Outbreak News report. The occurrence of sexual transmission of MPXV clade I was further established by the reporting in September 2023 of several new cases exposed through sexual contact with a known case in Kamituga health zone, in South Kivu province. Since then, the number of cases reported in South Kivu has continued to increase, including among sex workers and their contacts, and from an increasing number of health zones. Case investigations and subsequent outbreak investigations together with virus genetics confirm the sustained human-to-human transmission of MPXV clade I in the area without suspected animal exposure. On 1 June 2024, the first case of mpox was confirmed in North Kivu Province, in Karisimbi Health Zone in the city of Goma[1]. A 19-year-old woman presented with a macular skin rash, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dysuria (pain on urination), headache and genital lesions. PCR of swabs from the skin lesions tested positive for MPXV. A total of 45 contacts are being followed-up. In-depth epidemiological investigation identified a sexual contact with suspected mpox and a travel history to South Kivu Province. The contact reportedly traveled onwards to Masisi Health Zone, North Kivu, where the investigation continues. The case of mpox in Goma, North Kivu, which is characterized by insecurity, is the first ever reported case in that province.  Overall, in 2023, a total of 14 626 mpox cases and 654 deaths (CFR) 4.5%) were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, representing the highest figures in the recorded in the country and the highest among countries in the WHO African Region. Among these cases, 1 461 (10%) were laboratory-tested, of which 966 were positive (test positivity, 68%).  In 2024, as of 26 May, a total of 7 851 mpox cases were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including 384 deaths (CFR 4.9%). These cases were reported in 177 of the 519 (34%) health zones across 22 out of the 26 provinces (85%). The new case in Goma raises this to 23 of 26 (88%) provinces. The most affected provinces in 2024 are Equateur, Sud Ubangi, Sankuru and South Kivu (Figure 1). Figure 1. Geographic distribution of reported mpox cases, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1 January to 26 May 2024 (n=7 851).   Source: National mpox integrated disease surveillance data, Democratic Republic of the Congo North Kivu will be included in the next update to include the new outbreak in Goma. In 2024, children continue to represent the most affected age group (Table 1) of the 7 851 reported mpox cases, 39% were reported in children aged under 5 years (n=3 090), including 240 deaths (62% of the total).

Scabs, vesicles, and blood samples were taken from 1 415 reported cases. Of these, 994 were laboratory-confirmed as positive for MPXV, representing test positivity of 70%. Among the provinces with reported mpox cases in 2024, 15 out of 22 (68%) have confirmed at least one case this year (Figure 2). Among confirmed cases with the information available, 59% (502 of 852) are male 50% of confirmed cases are under 15 years of age (Figure 3).  Figure 2.

In 2024, the proportion of reported mpox cases tested at national level has fluctuated between 8 and 30% (Figure 4). As of 26 May 2024, 18% (1 415 of 7 851) of all reported cases had been tested. Supported by expanded testing capacity, this represents an 80% increase compared to the 10% of reported cases tested in 2023.  Figure 4.

The introduction of GeneXpert for field-based PCR diagnostics in two key provinces, Equateur and South Kivu, along with ongoing efforts to test for MPXV using GeneXpert in Tshopo and Tshuapa, is significantly improving the capacity for mpox diagnostics and surveillance. However, cases confirmed by GeneXpert in 2024 have not yet been included in the national case count pending completion of GeneXpert test validation exercise.  Currently, only clade I MPXV has been detected in the country. In late 2023, testing for clade II MPXV was introduced in the national laboratory and is used for new cases/clusters in previously unaffected provinces.   New variant detected in South Kivu In South Kivu, between 1 January and 2 June 2024, 777 cases were reported through the national surveillance system after investigation of alerts. Following laboratory testing of samples from 426 out of 777 cases (55%), 373 cases were confirmed as positive (test positivity of 88%), including seven deaths (CFR 1.8% among confirmed cases).   The mpox cluster in South Kivu, initially detected in the Kamituga Health Zone and driven by sexual contact transmission, has been expanding geographically and currently 19 of 34 (56%) health zones have reported at least one mpox case.  The type of contact reported by cases includes sexual contact, non-sexual direct contact, as well as household and healthcare facility contact. No cases with suspected zoonotic transmission have been reported in the province since the start of the outbreak.  The majority of laboratory confirmed cases in South Kivu are among persons aged more than 15 years, and among those with age and sex data available, the sex distribution is similar, with 51% female and 49% male. Through genomic sequencing of MPXV samples collected between October 2023 and January 2024, a novel variant of clade I MPXV was identified in the Kamituga health zone. This variant carries a deletion of a gene that widely serves as a target for clade-specific molecular assays. This deletion was confirmed by the national reference laboratory, the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB), as well as other academic and public health institutes. The new variant was found to have predominantly APOBEC3-type mutations, indicating adaptation of the virus due to circulation among humans. It was estimated to have emerged around mid-September 2023, with sequence data suggesting sustained human-to-human transmission since then. It is not known if this variant is more transmissible or leads to more severe disease than other virus strains circulating in the country.  All publicly available virus sequences from clinical specimens from South Kivu in 2024 identify the strain to be the novel variant. However, in all other publicly available sequences from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including recent sequences from Equateur, Kinshasa and Tshopo, there is no evidence of APOBEC-3 type mutations. With the publicly available data, it remains unclear whether this novel variant evolved in South Kivu or in other under-sampled regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the larger Congo Basin area. Additional sequencing data from across the country and the larger Congo Basin area are needed to better understand the origins of this novel variant, and better understand all virus strains circulating in the country.  Mpox situation in WHO Africa Region Burundi Verbal reports of suspected mpox cases have suggested potential cross-border transmission from South Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As of 30 May 2024, no suspected mpox case has been officially reported from Burundi. An assessment of the national level of preparedness for mpox has been conducted, procurement of testing kits and inventory of medical stocks are ongoing. Discussions to develop a mpox contingency plan are also ongoing. Cameroon From 1 January to 30 April 2024, there have been 23 suspected cases of mpox, with five confirmed cases (four males and one female) and two deaths (40% CFR). Genomic sequencing of these cases has identified clade II as the responsible variant. Over the years, Cameroon remains to date the only country to have reported both clades I and II MPXV. In 2024 the confirmed cases are distributed across three regions Nord-Ouest (n=2), Sud-Ouest (n=2), and Littoral (n=1) regions, highlighting the potential for regional spread. Republic of the Congo (ROC) On 23 April 2024, the government declared a national mpox epidemic, activating the Centre dopérations durgence de santé publique (COUSP) and the Incident Management System on 3 May 2024. Genomic sequencing of MPXV samples confirmed clade I, similar to those found in endemic neighbouring areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. From 1 January to 30 May 2024, the Republic of Congo reported 19 confirmed and 10 probable mpox cases across four departments: Cuvette (14 cases), Likouala (two cases), Plateaux (two cases), and Pointe-Noire (one case). The modes of transmission for these cases have not been documented. As a result, there's a high risk of the outbreak spreading. The outbreak peaked during week 4 to 10 (from 21 January to 9 March) 2024, and no cases have been reported in more recent weeks. However, only 9 of the 35 suspected cases recorded in week 21 were tested (all negative), highlighting a low testing rate. Rwanda Given the proximity to South Kivu, preparedness activities have been ongoing in the country. Surveillance has been strengthened in districts bordering Bukavu. Between 28 April and 4 May 2024, teams from Rwanda Biomedical Centre, CDC, IOM and University of Rwanda (FETP residents) conducted mpox active case search, assessment of points of entry and health facilities readiness to detect and respond to mpox outbreaks, health worker sensitization and community awareness within Rusizi and Nyamasheke districts. As of 4 May 2024, 16 suspected cases were recorded from Rusizi (15) and Nyamasheke (1) districts. All the cases tested negative for mpox by PCR. The national mpox contingency plan is under finalization. South Africa From 1 January to 6 June 2024, five confirmed mpox cases have been reported, all of whom are men aged between 35 and 39 years old. All five cases have been sequenced as clade IIb MPXV. Two cases were reported in Gauteng province, and a cluster of three cases in KwaZulu-Natal province. The cases in these two clusters did not report any international travel history. Four of the five men initiated treatment with tecovirimat provided by WHO from the limited reserve for compassionate use, upon request of the Government of South Africa. The severity of all the cases identified in persons with immune suppressions suggests less severe cases are not being identified, tested or reported. Outbreak response is underway in collaboration with the HIV/AIDS control programme, including contact-tracing and clinician training. There is extensive travel between South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, linked to commercial and professional activity between the two countries.;2024-DON522
2024-06-14T12:43:00Z;Following further investigation and information sharing by national authorities in Mexico, this is an update to the Disease Outbreak News (DON) on human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5N2) published on 5 June 2024.  As was previously reported, on 23 May 2024, the Mexico International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) reported to PAHO/WHO a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus in a patient with underlying co-morbidities who subsequently died. This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally and the first avian A(H5) virus infection in a person reported in Mexico. Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico. In their update, Mexican authorities informed WHO that a national group of experts determined on 6 June that the patient died due to complications related to his co-morbidities and that genetic analysis performed by the national authorities identified that this virus has a 99% similarity with the strain obtained during 2024 in birds in Texcoco State of Mexico. Based on available information, WHO’s risk assessment is unchanged: the current risk to the general population posed by this virus is low. The risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.;Human infection caused by avian Influenza A(H5N2)-Mexico;Animal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.Avian influenza virus infections in humans may cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and influenza-associated deaths have been reported in persons with or without comorbidities.  Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. RT-PCR. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve survival prospects for some cases.;This new information does not change WHOs risk assessment. This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally, and the first A(H5) virus infection in a person reported in Mexico. The case had multiple underlying conditions, and although the source of exposure has not been definitively determined, genetic analysis by authorities in Mexico identified that the virus from the patient has a 99% similarity with the strain obtained during 2024 in birds in Texcoco State of Mexico.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected.  Human cases of infection with other A(H5) subtypes including A(H5N1), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8) viruses have been reported previously. Epidemiological and virological evidence available so far suggests that A(H5) viruses from previous events have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission between humans, thus the risk of sustained human-to-human spread remains assessed as low. According to the information available thus far, no further human cases of infection with A(H5N2) associated with this case have been detected. There are no specific vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5) virus infection in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (in human and birds) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risks and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.  Based on the available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low. If needed, the risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information, including information on A(H5N2) viruses detected in local animal populations, become available.;As summarized in the previous DON (link), on 23 May 2024, the Mexico IHR NFP reported to PAHO/WHO a confirmed case of infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus detected in a 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico who was hospitalized on 24 April 2024 in Mexico City. The case had no known history of exposure to poultry or other animals. He had multiple underlying medical conditions. His relatives reported that he had been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms. On 22 May, sequencing of the sample by the national authorities confirmed the influenza subtype was A(H5N2). The genetic analysis by the national authorities identified that this virus has a 99% similarity with the low pathogenicity (in birds) avian influenza A/chicken/Texcoco, México/CPA-01654/2024 (H5N2) strain, obtained during 2024 from birds in Texcoco State of Mexico. The detailed H5N2 virus genetic sequence from the patient specimen has been uploaded to GISAID.A national multidisciplinary group of experts was formed to investigate the cause of death. It included infectious disease specialists, pneumonologists, microbiologists and intensive care professionals. Upon review of the patients clinical history and records, the national multidisciplinary team concluded on 6 June that, although the patient had a laboratory-confirmed infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus, he died due to complications of his co-morbidities.No further cases were reported during the epidemiological investigation. The 17 contacts identified and monitored at the hospital where the man died and 12 additional contacts near his residence, were tested and the results were negative for influenza viruses. Samples from these persons were taken a month after the acute disease onset in the patient with confirmed influenza A(H5N2) infection. The results of the serological samples are pending. In March 2024, an outbreak of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5N2) was identified in poultry in Texcoco, State of Mexico, and a second outbreak of LPAI A(H5N2) in April in the municipality of Temascalapa in the same state (1). Additionally, in March 2024, a high pathogenicity avian influenza A(H5N2) outbreak was detected in a backyard poultry farm in the state of Michoacán. A study describing the continuous circulation of low pathogenicity avian influenza H5N2 viruses in Mexico and spread to several other countries was published in 2022 (2), indicating that both LPAI and HPAI A(H5) subtypes were reported in avian species in Mexico recently and in past years.;2024-DON524
2024-06-11T13:42:10Z;On 22 May 2024, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) for India reported to WHO a case of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus detected in a child resident of West Bengal state in India. This is the second human infection of avian influenza A(H9N2) notified to WHO from India, with the first in 2019. The child has recovered and was discharged from hospital. According to the IHR (2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Most human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses are exposed to the virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.Based on available information, further sporadic human cases could occur as this virus is one of the most prevalent avian influenza viruses circulating in poultry in different regions. With the currently available evidence, WHO assesses the current public health risk to the general population posed by this virus as low. However, the risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.;Avian Influenza A (H9N2)- India;Animal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or through indirect contact with contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.Avian influenza virus infections in humans may cause diseases ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to more severe diseases and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported. Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods.;Most human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses are exposed to the virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. However, globally, there have been some hospitalized cases and two fatal cases reported in the past. Given the continued detection of the virus in poultry populations, sporadic human cases can be expected.No additional confirmed cases have been reported in the local area based on joint investigations. Currently, available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability to be sustained in transmission among humans. Thus, the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. However, the risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available. International travellers from affected regions may present with infections either during their travels or after arrival in other countries. Even if this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.;On 22 May 2024, WHO received a notification from the IHR NFP regarding a human case of avian influenza A(H9N2) virus infection in West Bengal state, India. The patient is a 4-year-old child residing in West Bengal state. The case, previously diagnosed with hyperreactive airway disease, initially presented to the paediatrician with fever and abdominal pain on 26 January 2024. On 29 January, the patient developed seizures and was brought to the same paediatrician. On 1 February, the patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) of a local hospital due to the persistence of severe respiratory distress, recurrent high-grade fever and abdominal cramps. The patient was diagnosed with post-infectious bronchiolitis caused by viral pneumonia. On 2 February, the patient tested positive for influenza B and adenovirus at the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at the local government hospital. The patient was discharged from the hospital on 28 February 2024.On 3 March, with a recurrence of severe respiratory distress, he was referred to another government hospital and was admitted to the pediatric ICU and intubated. On 5 March, a nasopharyngeal swab was sent to the Kolkata Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory and tested positive for influenza A (not sub-typed) and rhinovirus. The same sample was sent to the National Influenza Centre at the National Institute of Virology in Pune for subtyping. On 26 April, the sample was sub-typed as influenza A(H9N2) through a real-time polymerase chain reaction.  On 1 May, the patient was discharged from the hospital with oxygen support. Information on the vaccination status and details of antiviral treatment were not available at the time of reporting.The patient had exposure to poultry at home and in the surroundings. There were no known persons reporting symptoms of respiratory illness in the family, the neighbourhood, or among healthcare workers at health facilities attended by the case at the time of reporting.This is the second human infection of avian influenza A(H9N2) virus infection notified to WHO from India, with the first in 2019. Further sporadic human cases could occur as this virus is one of the most prevalent avian influenza viruses circulating in poultry in different regions.;2024-DON523
2024-06-11T09:53:00Z;On 27 May 2024, the Ministry of Public Health of Cuba reported outbreaks of Oropouche virus disease from two provinces, Santiago de Cuba and Cienfuegos. Oropouche virus disease is an arboviral disease caused by the Oropouche virus (OROV). It is transmitted to humans through midge (small fly) or mosquito bites. To date, there is no evidence of human-to-human Oropouche virus transmission. This is the first detection of the disease in the country, therefore, the population is likely highly susceptible and there is significant risk of additional cases being detected.;Oropouche virus disease - Cuba;Oropouche virus disease is an arboviral disease caused by the Oropouche virus (OROV), a segmented single-stranded RNA virus that is part of the genus Orthobunyavirus of the Peribunyaviridae family.  The virus has been found to circulate in Central and South America and the Caribbean. OROV can be transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of the Culicoides paraensis midge, found in forested areas and around water bodies, or certain Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitos. It is suspected that viral circulation includes both epidemic and sylvatic cycles. In the sylvatic cycle, primates, sloths, and perhaps birds are the vertebrate hosts, although a definitive arthropod vector has not been identified. In the epidemic cycle, humans are the amplifying host and OROV is transmitted primarily through the bite of the Culicoides paraensis midge. To date, there is no evidence of human-to-human OROV transmission.  The disease symptoms are similar to dengue and start between four to eight days (range between three-12 days) after the infective bite. The onset is sudden, usually with fever, headache, joint stiffness, pain, chills, and sometimes persistent nausea and vomiting, for up to five to seven days. Severe clinical presentation is rare, but it may result in aseptic meningitis. Most cases recover within seven days, however, in some patients, convalescence can take weeks. There is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for Oropouche virus disease.;This is the first detection of the disease in the country, therefore, the population is likely highly susceptible and there is a significant risk of additional case detection.  To date, there is no evidence of human-to-human Oropouche virus transmission.  In the Region of the Americas, outbreaks of Oropouche virus disease have occurred mainly in the Amazon region over the past 10 years. The virus is endemic in many South American countries, in both rural and urban communities. Outbreaks are periodically reported in Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago.   There is a risk of the disease spreading internationally as Cuba is an international tourist destination and the putative vector is widely distributed in the Americas region. Additionally, there are currently other countries with active OROV circulation.;On 27 May 2024, the Ministry of Public Health of Cuba reported the first ever outbreak of Oropouche virus disease. A total of 74 confirmed cases were reported from Province of Santiago de Cuba (n=54), and from Province of Cienfuegos (n=20). These cases were detected through strengthened monitoring and surveillance actions following an increase in cases with non-specific febrile illness in the provinces of Santiago de Cuba, with the municipalities of Santiago de Cuba and Songo La Maya reporting 29 and 25 cases each and in the province of Cienfuegos where eight cases were reported from Cienfuegos, five from Rodas, five from Abreu, and one each from Aguada de Pasajeros and Cumanayagua municipalities. OROV was identified in 74 samples of the 89 samples tested at the national reference laboratory of the Pedro Kour  Institute (IPK per its acronym in Spanish).  The onset of the symptoms of the confirmed cases was reported between 2 May to 23 May with a peak of cases observed in epidemic week 21 (week ending 24 May). The most frequently reported symptoms were fever, lower back pain, headache, loss of appetite, vomiting, weakness, joint pain, and eye pain. Of the 74 confirmed cases, 36 are male, and 38 are female, and the median age is 34 years (range 6-72 years). The most represented age range is 15 to 19-years-old (12 cases). All cases showed signs of recovery between the third and fourth day after the onset of symptoms. No severe or fatal cases have been reported as of 5 June.

2024-06-07T17:06:56Z;On 22 May 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of a laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus (clade 2.3.2.1a) by the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) of Australia.  This is the first confirmed human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5N1) virus detected and reported by Australia. Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, the exposure likely occurred in India, where the case had travelled, and where this clade of A(H5N1) viruses has been detected in birds in the past. According to the IHR (2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low.;Avian Influenza A (H5N1) - Australia;Animal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.Avian influenza virus infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to more severe disease and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported. There have also been several detections of A(H5N1) virus in asymptomatic persons who had exposure to infected birds.Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g., RT-PCR. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival in some cases.From 2003 to 22 May 2024, 891 cases of human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1), including 463 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 24 countries. Almost all of these cases have been linked to close contact with infected live or dead birds, or contaminated environments.India has reported detections of avian influenza A(H5N1) in domestic birds in 2024 to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). As the virus continues to circulate in poultry, the potential for further sporadic human cases remains. This is the first human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) reported in Australia. In this case, the exposure likely occurred in India where this clade of A(H5N1) viruses has been detected in birds in the past, although the likely source of exposure to the virus is currently unknown.;This is the first human infection with an avian influenza A(H5N1) virus reported by Australia. Most human cases of infection with avian influenza viruses reported to date have been due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Currently, the likely source of exposure to the virus in the case remains unknown but likely occurred in India where the patient travelled before onset of illness.Human infection can cause severe disease and has a high mortality rate. These A(H5N1) influenza viruses, belonging to different genetic groups, do not easily infect humans, and human-to-human transmission thus far appears unusual. As the virus continues to circulate in poultry, particularly in rural areas, the potential for further sporadic human cases remains.Currently, available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus, the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low.Based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low. The risk assessment will be reviewed if additional virological and epidemiological information becomes available.;On 17 May 2024, the WHO Collaborating Centre (WHO CC) for Reference and Research on Influenza in Australia notified the NFP of Australia of a suspected case of human A(H5N1) avian influenza (HPAI) in Melbourne, Victoria. The state Victorian Department of Health confirmed this case on 18 May 2024. Under Article 44, the NFP of Australia advised the NFP of India of the confirmed case on 21 May 2024. Under Article 8, the IHR NFP of Australia notified WHO of the case on 22 May 2024. The case is a 2.5-year-old-female child with no underlying conditions.  She had a history of travel to Kolkata, India from 12 to 29 February 2024. She returned to Australia on 1 March 2024.Upon returning to Australia, the child presented at a hospital in Victoria on 2 March 2024, where she received medical care and was admitted on the same day. On 4 March, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit at a referral hospital in Melbourne, Victoria, due to worsening symptoms, for a period of one week. The patient was discharged from hospital after a 2.5-week admission. The case is now reported to be clinically well. The Victorian Department of Health reported on 23 May 2024 that the family advised that the child started to feel unwell on 25 February 2024, with loss of appetite, irritability and fever, and was taken to a doctor on the evening of 28 February 2024 in India. She was febrile, coughing and vomiting and was given paracetamol. It was not reported to an Australian airport biosecurity officer that the child was unwell when she arrived in Australia on 1 March 2024.Additional information provided by the family indicates that the case did not travel outside of Kolkata, India, and did not have any known exposure to sick persons or animals while in India. It is understood that no close family contacts of the case in Australia or India developed symptoms, as of 22 May 2024.A nasopharyngeal swab and endotracheal aspirate taken on 6 and 7 March respectively tested positive for influenza A at the referral hospital. The samples were sent to the WHO CC for further characterisation on 3 April as part of a batch, as there was insufficient knowledge from the referring practitioners at the hospital to connect the case to the H5N1 virus. Virus genetic sequence obtained from the samples confirmed the subtype A(H5N1) and indicated that the haemagglutinin (HA) gene belonged to clade 2.3.2.1a, which circulates in South-East Asia and has been detected in previous human infections and in poultry.;2024-DON519
2024-06-05T16:24:23Z;On 23 May 2024, the Mexico International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) reported to PAHO/WHO a confirmed fatal case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus detected in a resident of the State of Mexico who was hospitalized in Mexico City. This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally and the first avian H5 virus infection in a person reported in Mexico.

The case had multiple underlying medical conditions. The cases relatives reported that the case had already been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms.On 17 April, the case developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general malaise. On 24 April, the case sought medical attention, was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases  Ismael Cosio Villegas  (INER per its acronym in Spanish) and died the same day due to complications of his condition.Results from Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) of a respiratory sample collected and tested at INER on 24 April indicated a non-subtypeable influenza A virus. On 8 May, the sample was sent for sequencing to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Emerging Diseases Center for Research in Infectious Diseases (CIENI per its acronym in Spanish) of INER, which indicated that the sample was positive for influenza A(H5N2). On 20 May, the sample was received at the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE per its acronym in Spanish) of the Mexico National Influenza Centre, for analysis by RT-PCR, obtaining a positive result for influenza A. On 22 May, sequencing of the sample confirmed the influenza subtype was A(H5N2).No further cases were reported during the epidemiological investigation. Of the 17 contacts identified and monitored at the hospital where the case died, one reported a runny nose between 28 and 29 April. Samples taken from these hospital contacts between 27 and 29 May tested negative for influenza and SARS-CoV 2. Twelve additional contacts (seven symptomatic and five asymptomatic) were identified near the case's residence. Samples of pharyngeal exudate, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were obtained from these individuals. On 28 May, the InDRE reported that all twelve samples from contacts near the patient's residence tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B, as determined by RT-PCR. The results of the serological samples are pending.In March 2024, a high pathogenicity avian influenza A(H5N2) outbreak was detected in a backyard poultry farm in the state of Michoacán, which borders the State of Mexico where the case was residing Additionally, in March 2024, an outbreak of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A(H5N2) was identified in poultry in Texcoco, State of Mexico, and a second outbreak of LPAI A(H5N2) in April in the municipality of Temascalapa in the same state. Thus far, it has not been possible to establish if this human case is related to the recent poultry outbreaks (1). A study describing the continuous circulation of low pathogenicity avian influenza H5N2 viruses in Mexico and spread to several other countries was published in 2022 (2).;2024-DON520
2024-05-30T10:31:02Z;As of 30 April 2024, over 7.6 million dengue cases have been reported to WHO in 2024, including 3.4 million confirmed cases, over 16 000 severe cases, and over 3000 deaths. While a substantial increase in dengue cases has been reported globally in the last five years, this increase has been particularly pronounced in the Region of the Americas, where the number of cases has already exceeded seven million by the end of April 2024, surpassing the annual high of 4.6 million cases in 2023.  Currently, 90 countries have known active dengue transmission in 2024, not all of which have been captured in formal reporting. In addition, many endemic countries do not have strong detection and reporting mechanisms, so the true burden of dengue globally is underestimated. In order to control transmission more effectively, real-time robust dengue surveillance is needed to address concerns about potential undetected cases, co-circulation and misdiagnosis as other arboviruses, and unrecorded travel movements. These factors could contribute to unrecognized disease spread and establish a potential risk for local transmission in non-endemic countries. Dengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Cases are most commonly asymptomatic or result in mild febrile illness. However, some cases will develop severe dengue, which may involve shock, severe bleeding or severe organ impairment. To strengthen global surveillance, and monitor temporal trends and disease incidence, WHO has established a global dengue surveillance system with monthly reporting across all WHO regions with a new dashboard now live (https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/dengue_global/). The overall capacity for countries to respond to multiple, concurrent outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources, including shortages of good quality dengue diagnostic kits for early disease detection, lack of trained clinical and vector control staff and community awareness. Emergency response mechanisms have been established, and WHO supports high-risk countries across affected regions.Given the current scale of the dengue outbreaks, the potential risk of further international spread and the complexity of factors impacting transmission, the overall risk at the global level is still assessed as High and thus dengue remains a global threat to public health.;Dengue - Global situation;Dengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes typically in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, though in some regions such as Europe and North America, this latter vector is more widespread. DENV has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the same serotype and only transient immunity to the other serotypes, after which secondary infections with a different serotype increase the risk for severe dengue. Dengue cases are most commonly asymptomatic or result in mild febrile illness. However, some cases will develop severe dengue, which may involve shock, severe bleeding or severe organ impairment. This stage often starts after the fever has gone away and it is preceded by warning signs such as intense abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding gums, fluid accumulation, lethargy or restlessness, and liver enlargement.   There is no specific treatment for dengue, but the timely diagnosis of dengue cases, identification of warning signs for severe dengue, and appropriate clinical management are key elements of care to prevent the progression to severe dengue and deaths.;Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the dengue virus, with the potential to cause a serious public health impact. Dengue infections are the most common vector-borne viral infections worldwide, particularly impacting tropical and subtropical countries.  DENV has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality. The virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, most commonly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The proliferation and propagation of mosquitoes depend on climatic factors such as temperature, humidity and rainfall. The arbovirus can be carried by infected travellers (imported cases) and may establish new areas of local transmission in the presence of vectors and a susceptible population. As they are arboviruses, all populations living in areas with the presence of Aedes aegypti are at risk, however, their impact largely affects the most vulnerable people, in which the arboviral disease programs do not have enough resources to respond to outbreaks.  Infection with one of the dengue serotypes (1-4) does not provide cross-protective immunity to the others, so persons living in a dengue endemic area can have four dengue infections during their lifetimes. Changes in the predominant circulating serotype increase the population risk of subsequent exposure to a heterologous DENV serotype, which increases the risk of higher rates of severe dengue and deaths.  Severe dengue is characterized by vascular leakage, hemorrhagic manifestations, thrombocytopenia, and hypotensive shock, which can lead to organ failure and death. Age, interval between infections, antibody characteristics, viral factors, and host-specific genetics are contributing factors. Monitoring of the global dengue situation to date has shown that several factors are associated with an increasing risk of dengue epidemics becoming more extensive and less predictable, and these include     Changing distribution of the Aedes aegypti vector Urbanization and human activities fostering conducive environments for vector-host interaction Climate change-induced shifts in weather patterns Fragile healthcare systems amidst political and financial instabilities Changes in the predominant circulating serotypes and co-circulation of multiple dengue serotypes Challenges in clinical diagnosis particularly in areas with co-circulation of other arboviruses Inadequate laboratory and testing capacity Prolonged ongoing concurrent outbreaks, including COVID-19 Insufficient preparedness for the scale of the epidemic, and low capacity for dengue patient clinical management Lack of specific treatment for dengueLack of engagement and mobilization of local communities in vector control activities Insufficient vector surveillance and control capacities Lack of coordination among stakeholders, chronic underfunding, and low donor interestLack of involvement of government sectors responsible for addressing social determinants e.g. implementation of policies aimed at improving conditions related to the risk of transmission, such as urban planning, water and sanitation provision, solid waste management, housing improvement, etc. Lack of engagement and mobilization of local communities in vector control activities.WHO assessed the global risk of dengue as high on 30 November 2023, and subsequently assigned a WHO internal emergency response grade of G3 at the global level on 1 December 2023. Given the current scale of the dengue outbreaks, the potential risk of further international spread and the complexity of factors impacting transmission, the overall risk at the global level is still assessed as high and thus dengue remains a global threat to public health.;Global overviewCurrent situationAs of 30 April 2024, over 7.6 million dengue cases have been reported to WHO in 2024, including 3.4 million confirmed cases, over 16 000 severe cases, and over 3000 deaths. While a substantial increase in dengue cases has been reported globally in the last five years, this increase has been particularly pronounced in the Region of the Americas, where the number of cases has already exceeded seven million by the end of April 2024, surpassing the annual high of 4.6 million cases in 2023. Furthermore, this is three times what was reported during the same period in 2023, highlighting the acceleration of this health problem.  Dengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Cases are most commonly asymptomatic or result in mild febrile illness. However, some cases will develop severe dengue, which may involve shock, severe bleeding or severe organ impairment. The risk of dengue is similar across regions, countries, and within countries. Factors associated with an increasing risk of dengue epidemics and spread to new countries include: early start and longer duration of dengue transmission seasons in endemic areas changing distribution and increasing abundance of the vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) consequences of climate change and periodic weather phenomena (El Nino and La Nina events) leading to heavy precipitation, humidity, and rising temperatures favouring vector reproduction and virus transmission changes in the circulating serotypes within a country affecting population immunity fragile health systems amid political and financial instability in countries facing complex humanitarian crises and large-scale population movements impairing the public health responsemovement of people who are infected and goods that could carry the mosquito vectors.Currently, 90 countries have known active dengue transmission in 2024, not all of which have been captured in formal reporting. In addition, many endemic countries do not have strong detection and reporting mechanisms, so the true burden of dengue globally is underestimated. In order to control transmission more effectively, real-time robust dengue surveillance is needed to address concerns about potential undetected cases, co-circulation and misdiagnosis as other arboviruses, and unrecorded travel movements. These factors could contribute to unrecognized disease spread and establish a potential risk for local transmission in non-endemic countries.To strengthen global surveillance, and monitor temporal trends and disease incidence, WHO has established a global dengue surveillance system with monthly reporting across all WHO regions, which is now available as a dashboard.   This has so far captured 103 countries (Figures 1 and 2) including 28 zero reporting countries. No autochthonous or locally transmitted dengue cases have been reported in Europe so far in 2024 but these data will be added when autochthonous cases occur, which can occur when seasonal conditions permit vector activity from June to November.   Given the current scale of the dengue outbreaks, the potential risk of further international spread and the complexity of factors impacting transmission, the overall risk at the global level is still assessed as High and thus dengue remains a global threat to public health.Figure 1. Epidemic curve of dengue cases and deaths as reported to WHO from January to April 2024** Note: includes 103 countries so far integrated in the WHO global surveillance system, 28 of which have submitted zero reports to dateFigure 2: Geographical distribution of dengue cases as reported to WHO from January to April 2024**Note: only 103countries integrated in the WHO global dengue surveillance system so far areshown Co-circulation of dengue, chikungunya and Zika virusesThere is considerable overlap in the geographic distribution of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, which are all transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and share some clinical features that can result in misdiagnoses and misreporting in the absence of differential laboratory testing. Surveillance data during large outbreaks of suspected dengue may erroneously include cases of one or both of the other diseases. For instance, in one study in Brazil (Ribas Freitas AR, et al., 2024), in the state of Minas Gerais in 2023, suspected dengue accounted for 84.4% of cases of the 828 654 cases of suspected arboviruses, and suspected chikungunya only accounted for 15.6%. The true proportion of the two diseases amongst laboratory-confirmed cases was 65.9% chikungunya and only 34.1% dengue. Surveillance systems specifically targeting endemic transmission of chikungunya or Zika are weak or non-existent in many countries. Misdiagnosis between diseases is a surveillance concern because skewed surveillance can misinform policy decisions. As dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses share the same Aedes mosquito vectors and co-circulate in the same geographic areas, they also share many prevention strategies, such as differential diagnosis, mosquito control and public awareness campaigns. However, there are important differences between these diseases that affect risk populations, patient management and use of health care resources. For instance, Zika is particularly dangerous for pregnant women due to its association with Congenital Zika Syndrome. Consequently, expanding surveillance to simultaneously monitor for all three viruses can help public health authorities accurately determine the true burden of each disease, refine risk assessments, and optimize clinical management and resource allocation for more effective public health interventions.So far in 2024, more than 250 000 cases of chikungunya have been reported to WHO and almost 7000 cases of Zika virus disease. Figure 3 shows countries/territories/areas with evidence of current or previous circulation of at least two of the three viruses.Figure 3: Countries, territories or areas with previous or current local mosquito-borne transmission of more than one Aedes-borne virus (dengue, chikungunya and Zika) as of 30 April 2024Regional overview African RegionThe African region is strongly affected by arboviruses, although the exact burden is not well understood due to challenges with laboratory capacity. There is evidence of current or prior dengue circulation in local populations and/or among travellers returning from approximately 30 African countries. In 2023, outbreaks were reported in 15 countries in the WHO African Region: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Chad, C te d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, S o Tomé and Principe, Senegal, and Togo.  In 2024, from 1 January to 28 April, 13 countries are known to have ongoing active transmission of the dengue virus – Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, C te dIvoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Niger, S o Tomé and Principe, Senegal, and the Seychelles. A total of 32 925 dengue cases (14 095 confirmed 1051 severe cases) and 57 deaths have been reported from these 13 countries and an additional 16 countries have reported zero cases through their respective routine surveillance mechanisms. Circulation of three of the four dengue serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3) has been identified in the WHO African region. The current priority countries based on dengue burden are Burkina Faso, Mauritius and Mali. Burkina Faso reported 72% of all cases and 89% of all deaths in the region from the beginning of 2023 to 28 April 2024, and remains the country with the largest dengue burden, reporting 17 098 cases (52%) and 38 deaths (67%) in 2024. Mauritius reported 7177 dengue cases and 15 deaths during the first 17 weeks of 2024, with only DENV-2 serotype being detected to date. In Mali between 1 January and 28 April 2024, a total of 3231 dengue cases and three deaths have been reported, with two serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-3) currently circulating. The main challenges in addressing dengue in the affected countries include funding constraints that hinder preparedness and response, shortages of rapid diagnostic tests, vector control specialists, lab technicians, and entomologists. Region of the AmericasDengue is the most widespread arbovirus and causes the highest number of arboviral disease cases in the Region of the Americas, with cyclical epidemics every 3 to 5 years. The Ae. aegypti, the first vector mosquito for dengue, is established in all countries in the Americas except Canada, which has also reported no prior autochthonous dengue cases. Previously, the highest burden of dengue was reported in 2023 with 4 600 086 suspected cases, including 2 048 048 laboratory-confirmed cases being recorded. However, in 2024 as of the end of April, there have already been 7 517 060 suspected dengue cases (3 528 635 laboratory-confirmed), 7374 (0.10%) severe dengue, and 3504 deaths (Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) 0.05%) reported. There are three times more suspected cases in 2024 to date than over the same period in 2023. Several countries in the northern hemisphere are also reporting a significant number of suspected dengue cases even though they have not yet entered their period of high transmission, which typically occurs in the second half of the year.  In 2024, Brazil is the country with the highest number of cases, with 6 296 795 suspected dengue cases (3 040 736 laboratory-confirmed), followed by Argentina (420 867 suspected cases), Paraguay (257 667 suspected cases), and Peru (199 659 suspected cases).  All four dengue serotypes have been detected across the region and in 2024 six countries (Brazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Panama) have already reported the simultaneous circulation of all dengue serotypes.   Eastern Mediterranean RegionDengue outbreaks continue to be reported in both fragile, conflict-affected, and/or vulnerable countries in the region that have weakened healthcare systems as well as countries with stronger healthcare systems that have been affected by unusual rains due to climate change. Ae. aegypti and some Ae. Albopictus mosquitoes have been identified in most of the countries in the region. In areas affected by armed conflict, the lack of detailed and timely information complicates a coordinated dengue response. Additionally, timely data sharing also remains a challenge for other countries in the region for reasons such as the potential impact in the tourism, economy and other sectors.  European RegionDengue is not endemic in the WHO European Region and reported cases are mainly travel-related. However, there have been sporadic autochthonous dengue cases and few dengue outbreaks reported in the region since 2010 with evidence of dengue transmission from five countries: Croatia, France, Italy, Portugal (Madeira), and Spain. In 2023, autochthonous cases were reported in three countries: Italy (82), France (45) and Spain (3). No autochthonous dengue cases have been reported in Europe so far in 2024, though the summer has not yet started when mosquito vector activity commences. Testing capacity for dengue is limited in many Member States in the WHO European Region, especially outside the European Union, and most cases likely are first-time infections and therefore mild and do not present for care, the actual numbers of dengue cases may be underestimated.  Strong public health systems, good clinical care including access to early diagnosis, case referral, and management of severe cases, relatively short vector season, and relatively unsuitable conditions for disease transmission all contribute to reduced severe health impact and further disease spread for both imported and autochthonous cases. The region is preparing for, likely limited, local transmission in the upcoming summer and early autumn months. The competent vector, Aedes albopictus, has been establishing itself further north and west in the European region over the past ten years. Additionally, Aedes aegypti has already been established in Cyprus, and Madeira, Portugal. While cold winters in the majority of the region do not allow for year-round transmission, the climatic suitability for transmission of dengue infections in the European region may increase with changes in climate, including potential higher temperatures and milder winters, increase in the geographical range of the competent vectors, and temperature suitability for virus transmission.  Changes in humidity and precipitation (followed by floods and stagnant water pools) may also create more favourable conditions for the vector population and therefore increased suitability for transmission of dengue virus.   South- East Asia RegionIn the South-East Asia Region, all Member States have the environmental conditions for dengue endemic transmission, and all have systematically reported dengue cases, except the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. There are clear seasonal patterns in dengue incidence, associated with the climate patterns in respective countries.  In 2024, Indonesia is experiencing a surge in dengue incidence, with 88 593 confirmed cases and 621 deaths as of    30 April 2024 - approximately three times higher than the same period in 2023. In 2024 Bangladesh, Nepal, and Thailand have reported a higher number of cases compared to the same period of 2023. From January to April 2024, the CFR varied from 0% in Nepal to 1.09% in Bangladesh. However, interpreting these values requires caution since the case definition used varies across countries with some countries reporting only (lab confirmed) hospitalized cases (compared to others reporting probable cases from communities), hence leading to higher case fatality rate among those hospitalized or severe dengue cases.     The surge in dengue incidence is likely triggered by various factors, including shifts in the circulating serotype and climate change. At least five countries (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand) are currently grappling with the initiation of monsoon season, which creates suitable conditions for Aedes mosquito breeding and survival. Additionally, urbanization and population movements have played a pivotal role in the increasing burden in the region. Changes in the predominant circulating serotype increase not only the incidence but also the population risk of subsequent exposure to a heterologous DENV serotype, which in turn increases the risk of higher rates of severe dengue and deaths. Western Pacific RegionThe Western Pacific Region continues to face a high burden of mosquito-borne arboviral diseases, particularly dengue, which is endemic in twenty-three countries in the region. In 2024, seven countries including Australia, Cambodia, China, Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Singapore, and Viet Nam have reported dengue cases Malaysia and Viet Nam are the most affected as of 22 April, reporting 50 650 cases and 39 deaths (CFR 0.07%) and 16 111 cases and one death (CFR 0.01%) respectively. Factors such as climate change, underdevelopment of infrastructure, cross-border population movements, and the resurgence of global travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, increase the risk of further international spread. The number of cases is expected to continue increasing once the rainy season begins in June.  There have not been any large outbreaks reported from Pacific Island countries/territories (PICs) in several years however in 2024, outbreaks have been reported in Fiji (3841 cases), Samoa (261 cases), Tokelau (130 cases as of 23 January 2024) and French Polynesia (43 cases). With ongoing travel between the PICs and the presence of competent Aedes mosquitoes, there is a risk of outbreaks occurring because of introduction from areas with active transmission. Member States in the region with endemic transmission continue to report longer seasonal dengue epidemics with increasing magnitude and geographic spread. However, disease burden estimation is less reliable due to the underreporting of cases, particularly in the PICs, based on their current syndromic reporting of dengue as dengue-like illness (DLI). Further, the reported number of deaths due to severe dengue is heterogenous across countries. As such, country-level and sub-national CFRs may appear inconsistent.  A subset of the region requires additional support for dengue to address operational gaps in clinical management, surveillance, laboratory support, risk communication and community engagement, and operational management. There is also a need to improve adherence to the existing WHO  Framework for National Surveillance and Control Plans for Aedes vectors  for non-endemic countries in the Pacific Region, particularly establishing a comprehensive Early Warning System that integrates climate, disease, viral/serological, and entomological surveillance.;2024-DON518
2024-05-08T16:40:02Z;The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of three human cases, including one death, of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) between 10 and 17 April 2024, by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). All three cases were males from Riyadh aged between 56 and 60 years with underlying health conditions and were not health care workers. The three cases are epidemiologically linked to exposures in a health-care facility in Riyadh, although investigations are ongoing to verify this and understand the route of transmission. Since the beginning of the year, a total of four cases and two deaths have been reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The notification of these cases does not change WHO’s overall risk assessment, which remains moderate at both the global and regional levels.;Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus-Kingdom of Saudi Arabia;Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection caused by the MERS-CoV. Approximately 36% of patients with MERS have died, though this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems, and the case fatality ratio (CFR) is calculated based only on laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels, which are the natural host and zoonotic source of the virus. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in health care settings. Outside of health care settings there has been limited human-to-human transmission to date.MERS disease ranges from having no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms, to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of MERS disease is fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, have also been reported. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, persons with weakened immune systems, and those with underlying health conditions such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes.The number of MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO has substantially declined since the beginning of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, this was likely the result of epidemiological surveillance activities for COVID-19 being prioritized. The similar clinical picture of both diseases may result in reduced testing and detection of MERS-CoV cases. Since then, the Ministry of Health of KSA has been working to improve testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV by including MERS-CoV into sentinel surveillance testing algorithms from the second quarter of 2023, following negative test results for influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2 (responsible for COVID-19). In addition, measures taken to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g., mask-wearing, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving the ventilation of indoor spaces, respiratory etiquette, stay-at-home orders, reduced mobility) also likely reduced opportunities for onward human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. Potential cross-protection conferred from infection with or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and any reduction in MERS-CoV infection or disease severity and vice versa has been hypothesized but requires further investigation.No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV-specific vaccines and therapeutics are in development. Treatment is supportive and based on the patients clinical condition and symptoms.;The notification of these cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries. In addition, cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk), or in a health-care setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.;Between 10 and 17 April 2024, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) reported three cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including one death, to WHO.  All three cases were reported in Riyadh and linked to the same health-care facility. Two of the cases were identified through contact tracing following identification of the index case.  The second and third case are suspected to be secondary health care associated cases due to contact with the index case. The investigations are ongoing to verify this and understand the route of transmission.The index case is a 56-year-old male school teacher, and a Saudi national residing in Riyadh. On 29 March, he developed a fever, cough, runny nose and body aches. He sought medical care at the emergency room (ER) of a hospital in Riyadh on 4 April, where case number three was also being treated. He was then admitted to a ward on 4 April, where he shared a room with case number two. On 6 April, he was transferred to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolation and intubated, was tested by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and was confirmed positive for MERS-CoV. The case had underlying health conditions, including hypertension and chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis . There was no clear history of exposure to typical MERS-CoV risk factors. Close contacts, including 20 health and care workers and seven household members, were followed up, which promptly identified the two secondary cases. Investigations, including determining the source of the infection, are still ongoing. The index case died on 7 April.The second case is a retired 60-year-old male Saudi national, residing in Riyadh. He was admitted to the ICU at the same hospital in Riyadh on 8 March 2024. On 31 March, he was transferred to a ward, where he subsequently shared a room with the index case on 4 April. The case developed a fever on 6 April and tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR on 8 April. He has underlying health conditions including heart disease and being a smoker. With no history of exposure to camels, the case is suspected to be a secondary healthcare-associated case due to contact with the index case, with investigations ongoing. The follow-up of 13 health and care workers and one patient has been completed, with no additional cases identified to date.  The third case is a 60-year-old male, retired military personnel and Saudi national, residing in Riyadh. On 4 April, he went to the ER of the same hospital in Riyadh, where the index case was also admitted. He was then admitted to the ward (different to the one that the index case and case number two shared) on 5 April. He developed shortness of breath on 10 April and was transferred to the ICU on 15 April. He tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR on the same day. He has underlying health conditions including chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis, malignancy, and liver disease.  No history of exposure to camels was identified and, like the second case, he is suspected to be a secondary healthcare-associated case due to contact with the index case. A follow-up of 14 health care workers is ongoing, with no additional cases identified to date.   As of 21 April 2024, the second and third cases remained in the ICU and were intubated on 9 April and 18 April, respectively. Additionally, since the last Disease Outbreak News (DON) published on 16 February 2024, one further case has been notified through IHR mechanisms with no epidemiological link to the three cases described above.  The case is a 32-year-old male with comorbidities from Taif, KSA who had had direct contact with camels, he had onset of symptoms on 21 January and died on 17 February 2024.Since the first report of MERS-CoV case in KSA in 2012 until 21 April 2024, a total of 2204 human cases and 860 deaths have been reported (Figure 1). Overall, a total of 2613 MERS-CoV cases and 941 deaths have been reported from 27 countries, in all six WHO regions. Of these 84% of the cases and 91% of the deaths have been reported from KSA, including these newly reported cases and death.  Since 2019, no MERS-CoV cases have been reported from countries outside the Middle East.There was one large outbreak outside of the Middle East in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015. It was characterized as a health care-associated infection, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in the Republic of Korea and 1 in China) and 38 deaths were reported however, the index case in that outbreak had a travel history to the Middle East. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR (2005) or directly by Ministries of Health to date. The total number of deaths is based on numbers reported to the WHO through follow-up with affected Member States.  Figure 1:  Epidemic curve of MERS-CoV cases (n=2204) and deaths (n=860) reported in KSA between 2012-21 April 2024*;2024-DON516
2024-05-08T15:52:19Z;On 5 March 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified by the Chad International Health Regulation (IHR) national focal point (NFP) of an outbreak of hepatitis E in the eastern Ouaddai province of Chad. Ouaddai province has been heavily affected by an influx of refugees and returnees fleeing the Sudan conflict since April 2023, with a majority being women and children.From 2 January to 28 April 2024, a total of 2092 suspected hepatitis E cases, including seven deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) 0.3%), were reported from two health districts of the Ouaddai province, namely, Adré and Hadjer-Hadid. Among the 2092 suspected cases, 103 (4.9%) were from the host community and 1989 (95%) were reported from seven refugee camps and transit sites. Both rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to confirm the diagnosis on collected samples. The most affected age groups are 6 -17 years (1113 cases) and 18-59 years (500 cases), representing 53.2% and 23.9% of the suspected cases respectively. A total of 27 pregnant women (1.3%) have been reported among the suspected cases. Hepatitis E is often occurring in humanitarian settings such as in areas affected by conflict and in displacement sites.   Limited access to safe drinking water and inadequate sanitation and hygiene increases the risk of hepatitis E virus outbreaks.  The Public Health Emergency Operations Centre has been activated by the national health authorities. WHO deployed a multidisciplinary team in Adré to support setting up the response and response activities are ongoing with partners support. Prevention is the most effective approach against hepatitis E. Provision of safe drinking water, good hygiene practices, quality standards for public water supplies and provision of safely managed sanitation services can significantly decrease the risk of spread.WHO assesses the risk to be high at the national level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level.;Hepatitis E - Chad;Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is common in countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia with limited access to adequate safe drinking water, poor sanitation and personal hygiene, limited health services or in areas of humanitarian emergencies. HEV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, mainly through contaminated water. The risk factors for hepatitis E are related to poor sanitation conditions, which allow the virus excreted in the feces of infected subjects to reach water intended for human consumption. The infection resolves spontaneously in 2-6 weeks with a 0.5-4% lethality. Fulminant hepatitis, a severe liver function impairment caused by HEV, is more common in pregnancy. Pregnant women, especially in their second and third trimesters, are at increased risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss, and mortality. The case-fatality rate can be as high as 10%-50% in women in their last trimester of pregnancy.;The outbreak is occurring in the Ouaddai province which has been heavily affected by an influx of refugees and returnees fleeing armed conflict in neighbouring Sudan since April 2023. The majority of hepatitis E cases have been reported from the Adré health district hosting three refugee camps with an average of 50 000 refugees per camp and a temporary refugee site housing approximately 170 000 refugees (UNHCR estimate).The risk at the national level is assessed as high due to the continuous population movements between different refugee camps and host communities poor hygiene conditions, low access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation facilities including wastewater management as well as limited access to essential medical services in the affected camps challenges in the management of cases among pregnant women. In addition, the limited financial capacity to effectively contain the outbreak also contributes to increasing the risk of spreading the disease in the Ouaddai province and across the rest of the country.Although no ongoing outbreak of hepatitis E has been reported officially in countries bordering Chad, the overall risk at the regional level is considered moderate because of the continued population movements between Chad and Sudan or the Central African Republic that raise fears of the spread of the epidemic in the sub-region. At the global level, the risk is considered low.;On 5 March 2024, WHO was notified by the Chad IHR NFP of an outbreak of hepatitis E in the eastern Ouaddai province of Chad. The initial alert of two cases of Acute Jaundice Syndrome (AJS) was raised on 2 January 2024, by a mobile clinic team supported by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) - Switzerland operating at the temporary high school refugee site in the Adré health district of Ouaddai province. From 2 January to 15 February 2024, 113 AJS cases were notified from the Adré health district. Of the 113 cases, 28 (24.7%) were tested using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for hepatitis E by MSF - Switzerland, eleven (39.2%) of which were positive. On 19 February 2024, the Hadjer-Hadid health district, bordering the Adré district, also notified its first suspected case of hepatitis E in the Allasha refugee camp.Between 1 and 19 March 2024, a total of 40 samples were tested by PCR at the Institute Pasteur of Dakar, Sénégal, for hepatitis E, yellow fever, dengue, West Nile fever, Zika, chikungunya, Rift Valley fever and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. Of the 40 samples, 36 (90%) were positive for hepatitis E. The median age among the confirmed cases is 36 years (range from 2 to 55 years). The male-to-female ratio among confirmed cases is 0.9 and three confirmed cases were in pregnant women.From 2 January to 28 April 2024, a total of 2092 suspected hepatitis E cases including seven deaths (CFR 0.3%) were reported from two health districts of the Ouaddai province, namely, Adré and Hadjer-Hadid. Among the 2092 suspected cases, 103 (4.9%) were from the host community and 1989 (95%) were reported from seven refugee camps and transit sites located in five health areas of the Adré health district (Aboutenguésite, Ambelia site, Hilouta camp, Lycée d'Adré site and Metché camp) and Hadjer-Hadid health district (Allasha camp and Arkoum camp).  Most cases have been reported from the Adré health district in Lycée d'Adré site (966 46.2%), Aboutengué camp (531 cases25.4%) and Metché camp (347 cases 16.6%). Males (1160 cases 55.4%) are the most affected. A total of 27 pregnant women (1.3%) have been reported among the suspected cases. The most affected age groups are 6-17 years (1113 cases) and 18-59 years (500 cases), representing 53.2% and 23.9% of the suspected cases respectively.  Hepatitis E often occurs in humanitarian settings such as in areas affected by conflict and in displacement sites.  Since January 2024, suspected cases of hepatitis E have been reported from camps hosting Sudanese refugees and Chadian returnees in the Ouaddai province of eastern Chad. Limited access to safe drinking water and inadequate sanitation and hygiene increases the risk of hepatitis E virus outbreaks in humanitarian settings such as war zones and camps for refugees and internally displaced people. The last hepatitis E outbreaks reported in Chad affected the Southeastern province of Salamat in 2017, with more than 1800 cases and 23 deaths recorded, and the southwestern province of Tandjile in 2021 with over 380 cases and two deaths reported.;2024-DON517
2024-04-19T10:21:51Z;The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified about a case of human infection with an influenza A(H9N2) virus in Viet Nam on 9 April 2024 by the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP). The patient, who had underlying conditions and was in severe condition was admitted to the intensive care on 21 March 2024.  A respiratory sample was collected on 21 March and tested positive for influenza by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Subsequently, virus subtyping confirmed avian influenza A(H9N2) on 8 April. Case investigation identified that the case lives near a poultry market, where poultry trade occurs daily in front of his house. As of 15 April, there have been no reports of new cases with respiratory symptoms among contacts of the case or outbreaks in the community where the case resides. This is the first human infection with an avian influenza A(H9N2) virus reported in Viet Nam.  According to the IHR (2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus as low.;Avian Influenza A(H9N2)- Viet Nam;Influenza viruses natural reservoir is wild water birds, but some influenza viruses may infect poultry and mammals, including humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Avian influenza virus infections in humans may cause diseases ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to more severe diseases and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. RT-PCR. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prognosis in some cases.To date, globally there have been 99 cases of human avian influenza A(H9N2) infections, including two deaths, reported to WHO since 2015.;Most human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses are exposed to the virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Further human cases can be expected since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations. No clusters of cases have been reported.Currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability to be sustained in transmission among humans. Thus, the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.;On 9 April 2024, the IHR NFP of Viet Nam notified WHO of one human infection with an avian influenza A(H9N2) virus.The patient is a 37-year-old male from Tien Giang Province, Viet Nam, who had underlying conditions. The patient developed a fever on 10 March 2024 and was admitted to the hospital on 16 March. Following a diagnosis of severe pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) on 21 March and received treatment with oseltamivir and antibiotics. As of 15 April, the patient was still in severe condition and under intensive care.The patient was detected through severe viral pneumonia surveillance (SVP). A nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 21 March, and the test result revealed positive avian influenza A with similar H9-strain gene segments on 22 March. On 1 April, Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (PI HCMC) performed PCR testing, which confirmed the presence of avian influenza A(H9) virus. Subsequently, virus subtyping confirmed avian influenza A(H9N2) on 8 April. Case investigation identified that the patient lives near a poultry market, where poultry trade occurs daily in front of his house. There have been no reports of dead or sick poultry near the patients residence or of consumption of sick, dead, or uncooked poultry products from his household or neighbouring households. However, influenza A(H9N2) is not highly pathogenic in poultry. On 2 April, seven poultry samples were collected from two live bird trading points within the same commune. One sample was positive A(H5N1) the remaining were negative for avian influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N6), A(H5N8), A(H7N9), and A(H9). On 4 April, samples were taken from two geese at the patient's house, which tested negative for A(H5) and A(H9).Fifteen close contacts of the case have been requested to self-monitor their health at home. As of 15 April, there have been no reports of new cases with respiratory symptoms among contacts of the case or outbreaks in the community where the case resides.This is the first human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) reported in Viet Nam.;2024-DON514
2024-04-10T12:12:49Z;The Timor-Leste government reported to the World Health Organization on 22 March 2024, its first confirmed fatal human case of rabies. The country is currently classified as rabies-free.The case, from Pasabe Sub-Region, Oecusse, with a history of dog bite on 26 December 2023, went to a local health center on 20 March and died on 22 March 2024. During 2024, as of 24 April, a total of 95 exposures to dogs have been reported in Oecusse Municipality. Ten dogs were confirmed positive for rabies using rapid diagnostic tests. Out of the 95 exposures, seven had been bitten by confirmed rabid dogs.The public health response is ongoing and includes vaccination of dogs, risk communication, training of healthcare workers on case management, active surveillance, and ensuring the availability of rabies vaccines and human rabies immunoglobulin.Based on the currently available information, the WHO assesses the risk posed by this event as high at the national level and low at regional and global levels.;Rabies;Rabies is a vaccine-preventable, zoonotic, viral disease affecting the central nervous system. Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is nearly 100% fatal. In up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for rabies virus transmission to humans. Yet rabies can affect both domestic and wild animals. It spreads to people and animals via saliva, usually through bites, scratches or direct contact with mucosa (e.g. eyes, mouth or open wounds). Children between the ages of 5 and 14 years are frequent victims. Direct human-to-human transmission has never been documented, however it has occurred from infected organ/tissue donors to transplant recipients.The incubation period for rabies is typically 2-3 months but may vary from 1 week to 1 year, depending on factors such as the location of virus entry and the viral load. Initial symptoms of rabies include generic signs like fever, pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensations at the wound site. As the virus moves to the central nervous system, progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops. Clinical rabies in people can be managed but very rarely cured, and not without severe neurological deficits. Rabies deaths occur mainly in those who cannot immediately access effective post-exposure prophylaxis. According to the Union Against Rabies Forum (launched by FAO, WHO and WOAH), globally, every nine minutes one person dies from rabies. Almost half of them are children.People can be protected against rabies through a vaccine given to individuals as pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis is the emergency response to a rabies exposure. This prevents the virus from entering the central nervous system, which would invariably result in death.;The risk at the national level is assessed as High due to the following: The country was previously classified as  rabies free  and has now reported      the first confirmed human case. As such, experience and awareness of      community and health care workers on rabies are likely limited.Oecusse, the municipality where the current case was bitten and reported from, is      an enclave of Timor-Leste located within East Nusa Tenggara province (NTT)      in Indonesia where rabies is endemic in both dogs and humans, and where      between 1 January and 15 March 2024, six human rabies deaths have been      recorded.Insufficient stock of human rabies vaccines in the government health facilities.The health workers in the areas considered at high risk of rabies have been      trained for dog-bite management. A recent survey shows that 91% of health      workforce in Oecusse have demonstrated knowledge of dog-bite management      including PEP and RIG administration. However, in other parts of      Timor-Leste health workers have limited knowledge dog bite and scratch      case management including PEP and RIG administration. The      rabies case management guidelines have yet to be finalized and training      needs to be conducted on clinical management.Timor-Leste has a significant population owning dogs and more than 70% vaccinated in      the areas bordering Indonesia. Dog vaccination programme is continuing very effectively. Currently more than      35,000 dogs are vaccinated as of 24 April 2024. Despite limited human      resources, 102 dog vaccinators are doing door-do-door campaign in the      border areas and Dili to provide dog vaccine. The frontliners from human health and those considered at higher risk have not      received pre-exposure vaccine due to non-availability of the same.Since Timor-Leste's only land border is with NTT province in Indonesia, which is already endemic for rabies (humans and canines), the risk of the international spread of rabies from Timor-Leste to other countries is unlikely. Available data indicates only the current one fatal case of rabies in Timor-Leste, with no links to international travel, tourism or international gatherings.;On 22 March 2024, the Timor-Leste Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry, reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) its first confirmed fatal human case of rabies. The case is a 19-year-old female from Pasabe Sub-Region, Oecusse, formally known as the Special Administrative Region of Oe-C sse Ambeno (RAEOA - Portuguese acronym). The case was confirmed by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCT) at the National Health Laboratory in Timor-Leste on 22 March from a saliva sample taken prior to the individuals death.On 20 March, the patient presented to a local health center with symptoms including high fever, vomiting, sore throat, cough, difficulty swallowing food, hydrophobia, photophobia, back pain, and neck stiffness. It was reported that she was bitten on the hands by a dog on 26 December 2023 in Oecusse. During the investigation, residents described the dog as very aggressive, and reported that it had not bitten anyone else. The dog died and was buried on 27 December 2023. The patient had not received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after the dog bite. On 21 March, she was transferred to Guido Valadares National Hospital (HNGV) in the capital city of Dili and died on 22 March 2024.As of 24 April 2024, a total of 95 exposures to dogs have been reported in Oecusse Municipality. The Tetanus Toxoid (TT) and Rabies PEP vaccines were administered to all. Rapid diagnostic tests have confirmed that ten dogs were infected with rabies. Out of the 95 individuals who were exposed to dogs, seven were bitten by dogs that were confirmed to have rabies. Among these cases, two individuals have completed their post-exposure prophylaxis vaccinations (as of 24 April 2024).   It should be noted that Oecusse is an enclave of Timor-Leste located within Indonesia East Nusa Tenggara province (NTT) where between 1 January and 15 March 2024, six human rabies deaths have been recorded. In 2023, a total of 30 human rabies deaths were reported from NTT province.;2024-DON513
2024-04-09T07:26:29Z;The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified about a laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with an influenza A(H5N1) virus on 1 April 2024 by the United States of America IHR National Focal Point (NFP).  The patient developed symptoms on 27 March and had a history of exposure to dairy cattle (cows) presumed to be infected with influenza A (H5N1) virus. This is the second confirmed human case of influenza A(H5N1) detected in the country. It also appears to be the first human infection with A(H5N1) acquired from contact with an infected mammal, although human infections with other influenza subtypes have previously been acquired from mammals.No additional associated cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) have been identified. Since the virus has not acquired mutations that facilitate transmission among humans and based on available information, WHO assesses the public health risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and for occupationally exposed persons, the risk of infection is considered low-to-moderate.;Avian Influenza A(H5N1) – United States of America;Animal influenza A viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.Avian influenza virus infections in humans may cause diseases ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to more severe diseases and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported in previous human infections with A (H5N1) viruses. There have also been a few detections of A(H5N1) virus in asymptomatic persons who had exposure to infected birds. Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. RT-PCR. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival in some cases. Avian influenza A(H5N1) virus belonging to Gs/GD lineage, clade 2.3.4.4b Eurasian-origin infections have been reported in birds in the United States since 2022. In late March 2024, HPAI A(H5N1) was also detected in dairy herds in Texas and Kansas (4,5).  This is the first human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in 2024 in the United States and the second confirmed detection in human in the country. This also appears to be the first human infection with A(H5N1) acquired from contact with an infected mammal although human infections with other influenza subtypes have been acquired from mammals. The first detection of influenza A(H5N1) in human in the United States was identified in April 2022, in a person involved in culling birds at a commercial poultry facility in Colorado (9). In the past, small clusters of A(H5) virus infections were reported, including some involving health care workers, where limited human-to-human transmission could not be excluded however, sustained human-to-human transmission has not been detected. In this event, the case had direct contact with cows presumed to be infected with A(H5N1) viruses and no further human cases have been detected associated with this event.;This human case was reportedly exposed to dairy cattle in Texas, where HPAI A (H5N1) has recently been confirmed in dairy herds.From 2003 to 1 April 2024, a total of 889 cases and 463 deaths (CFR 52%) caused by influenza A(H5N1) virus have been reported worldwide from 23 countries. The most recently reported case in humans prior to the current case, was in March 2024 in Viet Nam (11). The human case in Texas is the fourth reported in the region of the Americas, the most recent prior case having been reported in Chile in March 2023 (12).Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in birds, there is a risk for sporadic infections in mammals and humans due to exposure to infected animals (including livestock), or contaminated environments and thus, further human cases are not unexpected.  Influenza A infection has been rarely reported in bovine species and spread among dairy cattle herds in four U.S. States is being assessed. Previously, there have been human infections with other avian influenza subtypes following exposure to infected mammals. Since the virus has not acquired mutations that facilitate transmission among humans and based on available information, WHO assesses the public health risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and for occupationally exposed persons the risk of infection is considered low-to-moderate.There are no specific vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent H5 infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (from human cases and animal) and comprehensive investigations around human cases are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner. If needed, the risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.;On 1 April 2024, the IHR NFP of the United States of America notified WHO of a laboratory-confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) detected in the state of Texas.The case is aged over 18 years. On 27 March, the case developed conjunctivitis, was reported to be while working at a commercial dairy cattle farm and had a history of exposure to dairy cattle (cows) presumed to be infected with influenza A(H5N1) virus (1).  On 28 March, respiratory and conjunctival specimens were collected from the case and tested at the Texas Tech University Bioterrorism Response Laboratory. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that both specimens were presumptive positive for influenza A(H5) virus. The specimens were then sent to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) for further testing. They were received and tested at the US CDC on 30 March and confirmed as high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus clade 2.3.4.4b by RT-PCR and sequencing (1) (2). Genome sequencing of the virus didnt show new mutations possibly associated with increased transmission to humans. On 28 March, the patient was advised to isolate and given antiviral treatment (oseltamivir) following US CDC guidance. The patient did not report symptoms other than conjunctivitis, was not hospitalized, and at the time of reporting, was recovering (1).  Household contacts of the patient have not reported illness and have been provided influenza antiviral prophylaxis as per US CDC recommendations.  No additional cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) associated with this case have been identified (1). In the United States, since January 2022, detections of HPAI A(H5N1) virus among wild birds have been reported in 50 states or territories. There have been reports of sporadic A-(H5) virus outbreaks among poultry and backyard flocks as well as sporadic detections in mammals and outdoor cats on the dairy facilities as reported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Influenza A virus infection is exceptionally rare in bovine species (3). This human case had exposure to dairy cattle in Texas, presumed to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus (4)(5). On 25 March, the USDA reported the first detection of HPAI A(H5N1) virus in dairy cattle and unpasteurized milk samples from cattle in Texas and Kansas in four dairy herds. On 29 March, USDA announced confirmation of additional detections in dairy cattle in Michigan dairy cattle that recently received cows from Texas. USDA has also announced additional confirmed detections in dairy cattle in Idaho, New Mexico, and Ohio. To date, USDA has announced confirmed detections on 15 farms across six states: Idaho (n=1), Kansas (n=3), Michigan (n=1), New Mexico (n=2), Ohio (n=1), and Texas (n=7) (5,6,7). USDA is continuing to monitor and test samples collected from other farms where cattle are displaying decreased lactation, low appetite, and other signs (1,5,6,7). The USDA has publicly posted the genetic sequences of several recently detected HPAI A(H5N1) viruses found in US wild birds, poultry, wild mammals and cattle in Texas (8). The viruses are from clade 2.3.4.4b, which is the most common HPAI A(H5N1) virus circulating among birds worldwide currently.  CDC has publicly posted the genome of the virus identified from the patient in Texas and identified only minor changes when compared to the animal viruses (2).  Between 9 February 2022 to 29 March 2024, more than 8000 people were actively monitored in the United States following exposure to animals presumed to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses.;2024-DON512
2024-04-02T09:32:17Z;The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified about a case of human infection with an influenza A(H5N1) virus on 25 March 2024 by the national authorities of Viet Nam.The patient, who had no underlying medical conditions, developed symptoms on 11 March and died on 23 March. Exposure to birds was ascertained to have taken place in the third week of February. Samples collected from close contacts tested negative for influenza A(H5N1) virus.This is the first human infection with an avian influenza A (H5N1) virus reported in Viet Nam since 2022.According to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO.Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus as low.;Avian Influenza A(H5N1) – Viet Nam;Animal influenza viruses normally circulate in animals but can also infect humans. Infections in humans have primarily been acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses.Avian influenza virus infections in humans may cause diseases ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to more severe diseases and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported. There have also been several detections of A(H5N1) virus in asymptomatic persons who had exposure to infected birds in the days before a sample was collected.Laboratory tests are required to diagnose human infection with influenza. WHO periodically updates technical guidance protocols for the detection of zoonotic influenza using molecular methods, e.g. RT-PCR. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival in some cases.From 2003 to 25 March 2024, a total of 888 worldwide human cases of infection of influenza A(H5N1), including 463 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 23 countries. Almost all cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) have been linked to close contact with infected live or dead birds, or contaminated environments.Since 2003, 129 human infections with influenza A (H5N1), including 65 deaths, have been reported in Viet Nam. The most recent avian influenza A (H5) case was reported in October 2022 from Northern Province of Phu Tho, Viet Nam.;This is the first human infection with an avian influenza A (H5N1) virus reported in Viet Nam in 2024, and since 2022. Most human cases of infection with avian influenza viruses reported to date have been due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments.Human infection can cause severe disease and has a high mortality rate. These A(H5N1) influenza viruses, belonging to different genetic groups, do not easily infect humans, and human-to-human transmission thus far appears unusual. As the virus continues to circulate in poultry, particularly in rural areas of Viet Nam, the potential for further sporadic human cases remains.Currently, available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans thus, the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low.Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus as low. The risk assessment will be reviewed if additional virological and epidemiological information becomes available.;On 25 March 2024, Viet Nam National Focal Point (NFP) for International Health Regulations (IHR) notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of one case of human infection with an influenza A(H5N1) virus in a 21-year-old male with no underlying conditions from Khanh Hoa Province, Viet Nam. The case developed a fever and cough on 11 March 2024 and was admitted on 15 March to a local hospital due to persistent symptoms, including abdominal pain and diarrhoea. On 17 March, his condition worsened, and he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a provincial hospital. On 20 March, the patient was transferred to another provincial hospital with a diagnosis of severe pneumonia, severe sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The case died on 23 March.On 19 March, samples were taken for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing by the Pasteur Institut in Nha Trang, which resulted in a positive result for the influenza (H5) virus. On 22 March, genomic sequencing conducted by the Pasteur Institut of Nha Trang revealed the presence of the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.Initial results from the case investigation revealed that during the second and third weeks of February 2024, the case went bird hunting. Between that time and the onset of illness, no contact with dead or sick poultry nor contact with anyone exhibiting similar symptoms was reported. Among close contacts traced, no further cases of influenza A(H5N1) were detected.;2024-DON511
2024-03-20T13:35:53Z;Since the beginning of 2023, and as of 25 February 2024, a total of 13 countries in the WHO African Region have documented probable and confirmed cases of yellow fever (YF), namely Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, Togo and Uganda. Preliminary data for 2023 indicate a case fatality rate (CFR) of 11%. While the overall risk at the regional level was re-assessed as moderate and the global risk remains low, active surveillance is required due to the potential for onward transmission through travel and the presence of the competent vector in neighboring regions. The urban proliferation of Aedes spp. mosquitoes, which bite during the day, can also significantly amplify transmission risks, particularly in densely populated areas, leading to swift outbreaks.The WHO-led global Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) secretariat coordinated preventive and reactive efforts and notably during 2023, substantially enhanced vaccination coverage. Approximately 62 million people have been vaccinated in Africa through preventive and reactive mass vaccination campaigns. Additionally, under catch-up campaigns in Sudan, approximately 4 million individuals received vaccination against YF.;Yellow fever – African Region (AFRO);Yellow fever is an epidemic-prone, vaccine-preventable disease caused by an arbovirus transmitted to humans primarily through the bites of an infected Aedes spp. and Haemagogus spp. mosquitoes. The incubation period ranges from 3 to 6 days. Many people do not experience symptoms, but when they occur, the most common are fever, muscle pain with prominent back pain, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days. A small percentage of cases progress to a toxic phase with systemic infection affecting the liver and kidneys. These individuals can have more severe symptoms of high-grade fever, abdominal pain with vomiting, jaundice and dark urine caused by acute liver and kidney failure. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes, or stomach.  Death can occur within 7 to 10 days in about half of cases with severe symptoms.Yellow fever is prevented by an effective vaccine, which is safe and affordable. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to grant sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. The vaccine provides effective immunity within 10 days for 80-100% of people vaccinated, and within 30 days for more than 99% of people vaccinated.;As part of the ongoing efforts to monitor and respond to infectious disease outbreaks, on 12 February 2024, the World Health Organization conducted a Rapid Risk Assessment for yellow fever. It aimed to reassess the current regional risk of multiple ongoing YF outbreaks, in the context of a resurgence of YF outbreaks in countries with a history of preventive vaccination campaigns and persisting immunity gaps, including capacities to support the response (e.g., technical capacities, vaccine supply and vaccination campaigns, laboratory and operations, support and logistics (OSL)) and to provide recommendations for a more effective and coordinated response.The overall risk at the regional level was re-assessed as moderate based on several contributing factors observed in the region despite the efforts to control the spread of YF:Stable number of ongoing      outbreaks across the region.Persistence of pockets of unimmunized      populations although considerable efforts have been made in recent      years to protect the population through PMVC and reactive mass vaccination      campaigns (RMVC).Detection of YF confirmed cases in      urban areas, such as Douala city in Cameroon, which pose      significant risks due to high population density and international travel      connections, noting nevertheless the risk mitigation provided by a      relatively high average vaccination coverageRisk of cross-border spread, particularly      from the outbreak in South Sudan, which shares borders with neighbouring      countries.Limited surveillance and laboratory      capacity in certain regions may result in delayed detection,      underestimation of the extent of the disease and delayed response.Persisting response challenges with the case classification, investigation, and response operations,      exacerbated by competing health emergencies.Competing outbreaks strainthe capacity to respond effectively, with various simultaneous health crises,      including measles, poliomyelitis, mpox, cholera, diphtheria, hepatitis E,      Lassa fever, and dengue. These challenges are compounded by factors such      as food insecurity, security constraints, and complex humanitarian      contexts. Furthermore, public health and medical personnel are overburdened,      managing multiple parallel outbreaks alongside other health emergencies.Socio-economic factors, high      levels of poverty and limited resource allocation contribute to the      challenge of controlling outbreaks effectively.While the global risk remains low, active surveillance is required due to the potential for onward transmission through viremic travellers and the presence of the competent vector in neighbouring regions.While progress has been made in controlling outbreaks, ongoing challenges and vulnerabilities underscore the need for sustained and coordinated efforts to protect public health. The impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled, vaccination coverage is high and immunity gaps in the population closed. The importation of cases to countries with suboptimal coverage and persisting population immunity gaps poses a high risk and may jeopardize the tremendous efforts invested to achieve elimination.;Since the beginning of 2023, and as of 25 February 2024, a total of 13 countries in the WHO African Region have documented probable and confirmed cases of yellow fever (YF), namely Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, C te dIvoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, Togo and Uganda. Preliminary data for 2023 indicate a case fatality rate (CFR) of 11% and a sex ratio of 1.7 (M: F). The median age of cases is 25 years, with two-thirds (69%) of cases aged over 15 years.  Suboptimal surveillance capacity exists in many affected countries, with data fragmentation, limited integration with routine surveillance and clinical systems, and a lack of standardized case definitions that contribute to underreporting and increased mortality rates.During the last quarter of 2023 and as of 25 February 2024, a total of eight countries (Cameroon, Chad, Congo, DRC, Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, and South Sudan), have reported active YF transmission with confirmed YF cases (Table 1). These countries have initiated response planning activities.Chad, Gabon, Niger, Nigeria, and Togo** are currently awaiting the final classification of the YF laboratory plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) positive samples.Cameroon: Three YF cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, occurring in the weeks ending on 22 October and 13 November 2023. The country recorded probable and confirmed YF cases consistently throughout 2023, starting from the week ending 29 January 2023.Chad: A yellow fever PCR-positive case with negative serology was reported on 18 January 2024 from a patient sampled on 10 October 2023, in the Léré district of the Mayo-Kebbi Ouest region.Republic of the Congo: Cases pending classification with the national health authorities. No further information was available as of February 2024.Democratic Republic of the Congo: One YF PCR-positive case with unknown vaccination status was reported on    18 December 2023. Additionally, nine PRNT positive cases were recorded, eight of which have unknown vaccination status and one lacks information in the medical charts.Guinea: Three YF PCR-positive cases were confirmed at the Institute Pasteur Dakar (IPD). These cases were reported on 17 October and 23 December 2023 in a 6-year-old female from Faranah region, a 7-year-old male from the Koundara health district (sample collected on 6 December), and a 60-year-old female from the Guiéckédou district (sample collected on 15 December), representing three out of the seven countrys regions. Notably, this occurrence is less than three years since cases were confirmed in the Koundara health district in 2020 and 2021.Niger: Case reported in the Tahoua city, Department of Tahoua during the first week of January 2024. No further information was available as of February 2024. Investigations are ongoing. Nigeria: One YF PRNT-positive case was reported in January 2024 in Lagos state in a 49-year-old male residing in a rural area. Investigations are ongoing.South Sudan: A confirmed YF case was reported on 24 December 2023, following the investigation of suspected cases and deaths of viral hemorrhagic fever. The case, a 24-year-old male, presented with fever, vomiting blood, and jaundice. Two additional cases were confirmed on 2 February 2024. As of 12 February 2024, South Sudan reported a total of 64 cases that fulfil the current outbreak case definition of YF, including 61 suspected cases and three confirmed cases from six out of 10 counties in Western Equatoria state: Yambio (33), Nzara (09), Tambura (12), Ibba (4), Ezo (5) and Maridi Counties (1). Among 61 suspected cases, there were six suspected deaths currently under investigation.Figure 1.

In addition, she presented a YF-PRNT result of 1/60. The child fully recovered from symptoms.   This case is pending case classification with the Ministry of Health.;2024-DON510
2024-03-14T12:37:34Z;;Cholera - Sri Lanka;;;An increase in the number of cholera cases has been reported in the capital city Colombo. Of the 60 new cases reported in the week 16-22 November, 40 were registered in Colombo district (including 32 in the city itself).  No deaths have been reported.Public health inspectors have been mobilized to track down sources of infection in Colombo city.  In addition, the Ministry of Health has already implemented many cholera control activities throughout the country.  However, cholera has spread to several districts previously free of the disease, where sanitation remains inadequate.Sri Lanka is suffering from a cholera outbreak which started at the end of September 1997.  A total of 431 cases were reported for 1997.  As of 13 November 1998, the total number of cases notified for 1998 is 1 264, with 36 deaths. On average, 125 cases per month have been reported this year, with a case-fatality rate of 2.7 %;1998DON236
2024-03-14T12:28:00Z;;Rift Valley fever - Mauritania;;;An outbreak of Rift Valley fever has occurred in the Aioun area, in south-eastern Mauritania. There have been 300-400 human cases (febrile disease), including 6 deaths between 15 and 30 September (some with haemorrhage and icterus). The latter were aged between 14 and 40 years, and all were from areas where goats, sheep, cattle and camels are raised. In the Assaba area, 2 patients were admitted to hospital both died. The epidemic peaked in late September/early October, and the most recent case was reported around 25 October. Rift Valley fever virus has been isolated from 2 samples (1 postmortem) at the Pasteur Institute in Dakar (Senegal). Livestock were also severely affected (with up to 100% abortion rates for some species), which will have serious economic consequences for the population. The Ministry of Health has issued recommendations, and is carrying out investigations with the support of WHO and FAO.;1998DON235
2024-03-14T12:24:48Z;;Hurricane - Region of the Americas;;;Hurricane Mitch and associated flooding have affected 3-5 million persons in Central America, and caused an unknown number of deaths. Although epidemics are relatively rare in the aftermath of natural disasters, in this case there is a combination of high-risk factors which could lead to an increase in the transmission of communicable diseases: the magnitude of the hurricane, the large number of displaced persons, the contamination of drinking-water and poor sanitation conditions.Even though the mosquito population may decrease (washing effect of the storm) in the first weeks following the hurricane, it will inevitably rebound due to the subsequent accumulation of stagnant water. This could lead to an increased risk of malaria and dengue epidemics in an area that is already highly endemic for these diseases.Cholera is also endemic in Central America, and again the risk of transmission is likely to increase. Information regarding suspected cases of cholera in the suburbs of Managua (Nicaragua) has recently been received from field workers.Although no epidemic has been confirmed so far, WHO strongly recommends that relief agencies pay particular attention to epidemic readiness and water safety activities.;1998DON234
2024-03-14T12:20:24Z;;Typhoid fever - Kyrgyzstan;;;The Ministry of Health of Kyrgyzstan has informed WHO that an outbreak of typhoid fever has occurred in Osh Oblast. Since 7 September, 458 patients have been hospitalized and 46 cases have been confirmed as typhoid fever. WHO is in close contact with the Ministry of Health to control the further spread of the disease.;1998DON233
2024-03-14T12:14:40Z;;Cholera - Sierra Leone;;;The Ministry of Health and Sanitation has reported to WHO an outbreak of cholera, with 134 cases and 1 death between 1 and 6 September. Of 8 stool specimens sent for laboratory tests, 6 were positive for Vibrio cholerae O1 subtype Ogawa. Tests have revealed sensitivity to tetracycline, doxycycline and cotrimoxazole.WHO and other partners have been supporting the Ministry in taking appropriate control measures, e.g. reactivation of the cholera task force, establishment of specific subcommittees (for surveillance, case management and sanitation) and of cholera treatment centres. Mass health education campaigns are being carried out and communications networks are being strengthened. Available supplies are adequate for the treatment of 3 000 cases.;1999DON232
2024-03-14T12:11:24Z;;Shigellosis - Guinea;;;Following reports of an outbreak of diarrhoeal disease, a rapid-response team has visited the district of Dabola located 450km from Conakry. Out of 7 patients found and examined, 5 were suffering from bloody diarrhoea. Of 7 samples sent to the laboratory at Donka hospital, 1 was identified as Shigella dysenteriae type 1 resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and erythromycin it was however sensitive to nalidixic acid. All 7 patients have been treated with norfloxacin and have recovered. No new case has been reported.On 2 July, 2 stool samples were sent to the Institut Pasteur in Dakar (Senegal) for additional testing and to obtain confirmation of the diagnosis. Other samples will be sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United States. Surveillance measures in the area have been strengthened, and the Ministry of Health has requested additional stocks of nalidixic acid.;1999DON231
2024-03-14T12:07:37Z;;Viral haemorrhagic fever and Marburg haemorrhagic fever - Democratic Republic of the Congo;;;Latest information from the coordination committee in Durba*One additional case of Marburg fever has now been confirmed, bringing the total to 3 (the first confirmed case being the medical officer who died on 23 April). To date, 93 suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) have been reported.The exact number of deaths due to viral haemorrhagic fever has not been established, owing to the lack of precise information about the clinical picture of those who have died during the past several months. Previously, over 60 deaths had been attributed to the disease, but it is presently difficult, and may be impossible, to accurately determine the proportion due to haemorrhagic fever. All three confirmed Marburg cases have died.Of the 2 new cases, 1 was a woman who died on 7 May. She reportedly had lived 20-30 km from Durba, and preliminary investigation has not established a link with other haemorrhagic fever cases or with mining activities. Additional data about this case are being collected.On 17 May, the National Institute for Virology (South Africa) reported the confirmation of the third Marburg case, a miner who died on 13 May. This is the first death in a miner, linking Marburg fever with the cluster of deaths previously reported among the gold miners.A broad serological survey among the population of the affected area began on 17 May, and an isolation unit was set up in Watsa in addition to the unit in Durba. Cases are being actively followed up in Durba, and an intensive public information campaign is under way. The surveillance and advance warning systems in the province are being reinforced. In addition, an ecological team* has started collecting specimens from animals for virological studies.* The coordination committee is composed of experts from: the Ministry of Health and local health authorities WHO headquarters and the African Region UNDP Médecins sans frontières (Belgium and Holland) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (United States) Institut Pasteur (France, French Guiana and Madagascar) Institute of Tropical Medicine (Belgium). The ecological team is composed of experts from: the National Institute for Virology (South Africa) and the Pest Infection Laboratory (Denmark).

2024-03-14T11:57:53Z;;Cholera - Nigeria;;;An outbreak of cholera has been reported in Kano Municipal Local Government Area (LGA), Kano State, which started in late March. The outbreak was traced to the interruption of the domestic water supply for some days which forced people to use any water available. A total of 815 cases with 28 deaths has been recorded up to 6 May. The outbreak has now spread to Tofa LGA where 182 cases with 19 deaths were recorded over two weeks beginning in late April. Control measures including management and isolation of affected patients, intensification of health education and chlorination of all wells in affected communities have been taken. WHO gave technical support during the investigation and management of the outbreak as well as emergency health kits.Cholera outbreaks also occurred recently in Adamawa State (76 cases, 18 deaths) and in Edo State (49 cases 24 deaths). The outbreak in Adamawa State is now under control and no new cases have been reported in May. In Edo State technical assistance and transportation for the investigative team was given by WHO but basic drugs and supplies for management of patients were not available which led to the high case fatality rate.Medecins sans frontières (MSF), Holland, has set up a temporary treatment centre and 6 Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) centres, and are currently organizing a widespread health education campaign and training of local district health personnel.;1999DON229
2024-03-14T11:23:57Z;;Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome - Democratic Republic of the Congo;;;An outbreak of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever has been reported in Durba, Watsa Zone, in the northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Clinical features include fever, headache, lassitude, gastrointestinal bleeding, coughing up blood and agitiation. The first cases are believed to have occurred in January 1999. Between January and 28 April, 50 cases, with 46 deaths have been recorded (CFR=92%). The earliest cases appear to have occurred in gold miners, but now cases are occurring among those living in the community. The WHO Office in DRC and the WHO Regional Office for Africa in Harare, Zimbabwe and MSF(Belgium and Holland) are preparing a team to investigate. The security situation in the area is poor and access to the affected area may be extremely difficult.;1999DON228
2024-03-14T11:20:09Z;;Epidemic encephalitis - Malaysia;;;The following is a Press Release from the World Health Organization, Regional Office for the Western Pacific, WP/PR8, 25 March 1999.   For updates on the number of cases and deaths, please visit the web site of the Department of Public Health, Ministry of Health, Malaysia at: http://dph.gov.my/press/press2/japan_e.htmCases of viral encephalitis have been occurring in Malaysia since October 1998. To date, there have been 157 cases and 58 deaths. New information indicates that both Japanese encephalitis (JE) and a second virus are circulating. The second virus, a new member of the paramyxovirus family could be similar to the Hendra virus found earlier in Australia. Japanese encephalitis has been confirmed to be the cause of 18 of the reported deaths. Further investigations are now underway to determine the role of the new viruses in the reported cases.Japanese encephalitis (JE) is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia with 30 000 to 50 000 cases reported annually. Acute encephalitis can lead to paralysis, coma and death. In Malaysia, between 9 and 91 cases of JE are reported each year. Major outbreaks occurred in Langkawi in 1974, Penang in 1988 and in the Serian district of Sarawak in 1992.Japanese encephalitis virus usually affects pigs and is transmitted by the bite of culex mosquitos. Normally the disease is transmitted among pigs and it is only in exceptional circumstances that humans are involved.The initial stages of the current outbreak evidence pointed to JE because of the association of all the cases with pigs and piggeries. However, JE usually affects children but most of the cases in this outbreak have been young adult males. All have been workers at or closely associated with piggeries. This suggests the presence of another virus.The current outbreak of viral encephalitis involves the Kinta district of Perak and the Sikamat and Bukit Pelandok districts of Negri Sembilan state. The highest number of cases and deaths have been reported from Bukit Pelandok.The Malaysian Ministry of Health has mounted a well-funded campaign to control the disease. To date, 64 767 people have been vaccinated, 150 000 farms and houses have been sprayed with insecticide, and an active programme of health education and social mobilization has been mounted in affected areas. In addition, the Government intends to destroy more than 300 000 pigs as a means of eliminating the source of the virus.WHO has been monitoring the situation and has been in regular contact with the Malaysian Ministry of Health since early in the outbreak through its office in Kuala Lumpur. The Regional Office in Manila has provided technical advice, including information on JE vaccines.The WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus Reference and Research at the Department of Medical Microbiology of the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur has been at the forefront of the virological investigation of the current outbreak. Another WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institute for Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan has also been carrying out serological confirmation on samples from Malaysia.Two international teams, one from the United States of America and the other from Australia are now in Kuala Lumpur to help investigate the outbreak. Their role will be to carry out detailed serological and virological investigations that will provide a clearer picture of the dynamics of the current outbreak.WHO fully supports the control efforts being taken by the Malaysian Ministry of Health and is ready to provide technical advice and mobilize additional international resources to help control the current outbreak.;1999DON227
2024-03-14T11:13:39Z;;Yellow fever - Guinea;;;As of 27 December, 512 suspected cases, including 190 deaths have been reported in 15 districts in northwestern Guinea.

2024-03-14T11:10:50Z;;Cholera - South Africa;;;As of 18 December, the Kwazulu-Natal Department of Health has reported 8137 cases and 41 deaths since the start of the outbreak in mid-August 2000. Cholera cases and deaths are only reported once laboratory testing has taken place and cholera is confirmed. The cumulative figure of cases reflects the number of people who have contracted the disease, sought and received treatment in hospital, recovered and been discharged from hospital over a 4 and 1/2 month period. The recent heavy rainfall in the affected areas could have influenced the increased number of cases.The outbreak in Kwazulu-Natal is affecting: the Empangeni area, made up of the Lower Umfolozi districts, which include Hlabisa and Ngwelezane and the Eshowe/Nkandla area. The lower South Coast is affected mainly in the KwaDukuza/Stanger area and Ugu Region/South Coast.All piped and municipal water in Kwazulu-Natal is safe. Only people using water directly from rivers and dams are at risk and if good sanitation and personal hygiene measures are followed, the chances of contracting cholera are minimal.No special restrictions on travel to and from KwaZulu-Natal are warranted.;2000DON225
